<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In multimedia systems, different color reproduction devices -while serving the same purpose -exhibit large discrepancies in their raw output. This is due to the fact that they usually employ different color mixing technologies (additive or subtractive), Correspondence: Email: artusi@cg.tuwien.ac.at use different input color spaces and hence have different gamuts, and that their device characteristics can change with time and usage. These facts usually do not permit a faithful matching of colors between devices if no precautions are taken.</p><p>Colorimetric characterization is one step in the colorimetric reproduction process that permits faithful image reproduction across different display devices. Its goal is to define a mapping function between the device-dependent color spaces in question (such as RGB or CMYK) and device-independent color spaces (such as CIELAB or CIEXYZ), and vice versa.</p><p>There are three main approaches to defining this mapping function: physical models, empirical models and exhaustive measurements. Physical modeling of imaging devices involves building mathematical models that find a relationship between the colorimetric coordinates of the input (or output) image element and the signals used to drive an output device (or the signals originating from an input device). The advantage of these approaches is that they are robust, typically require few colorimetric measurements in order to characterize the device, and allow for easy recharacterization if some component of the imaging system is modified. The disadvantage is that the models are often quite complex to derive and can be complicated to implement. Physical models are often used for the colorimetric characterization of displays and scanners.</p><p>Empirical modeling of imaging devices involves collecting a fairly large set of data and then statistically fitting a relationship between device coordinates and colorimetric coordinates. Empirical models are often higher-order multidimensional polynomials, or neural network models. They require fewer measurements than LUT techniques, but they need more than physical models. Empirical models are often used for scanners and printers.</p><p>Often the colorimetric characterization of printers requires an exhaustive measurement in order to obtain good performances.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Typically ¡ £ ¢ ¤ ¡ ¥ ¢ ¦ ¡</formula><p>samples of the device drive signals are sampled and colorimetrically measured. Many more measurements have to be used for devices with poor repeatability.</p><p>Lookup tables can be used to process image data via multidimensional interpolation. This technique has different disadvantages: the large number of measurements that has to be made, difficulties in interpolating the highly nonlinear data and difficult recharacterization if any aspect of the device changes. The advantage of exhaustive measurement techniques is that they require no knowledge of the device physics.</p><p>In general a good algorithm for colorimetric characterization must have the following characteristics: small training set, fast response, good accuracy and it must allow for a fast recharacterization. This paper proposes a modification of an existing learning algorithm § to train radial basis function networks to solve the problem discussed so far, namely the colorimetric characterization of printers. This learning algorithm has fast training and test phases, good accuracy, and it also requires a comparatively small training set.</p><p>In section 2 we discuss related previous work, section 3 describes the background for radial basis function networks, the models used in our experiments, and the proposed new model. Section 4 explains how the training and test set were generated and reports some experimental results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">STATE OF THE ART</head><p>There is a large number of publications on the colorimetric characterization of printers that propose different models for solving this problem: <ref type="bibr">Kang</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">BACKGROUND</head><p>There are two main types of regression problems in statistics ¥ : parametric and non-parametric. In parametric regression the form of the functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables is known, but may contain parameters whose values are unknown, and it is possible to successfully estimate the desired result from the training set.</p><p>In the case of non-parametric regression there is no, or very little, a priori knowledge about the form of the true function which is being estimated. The colorimetric characterization problem, presented in these papers, is a non-parametric regression problem, because one does not know the mapping function properties the algorithm will arrive at in advance. There are different approaches to resolve non-parametric regression problems; when one uses equation systems in this context they may contain many free parameters that have no physical meaning in the problem domain (interpolation models, multiple polynomials regression), or one can use neural networks instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Neural networks</head><p>The base of a neural network is a formal neuron. It is defined as a series of inputs, a series of outputs and by a function that maps specific inputs to series of outputs. There are different neural network structures : total connected networks, partial connected networks, multilayer networks (feedforward, feedback), and autoassociative networks. In a neural network, the learning phase is a process where a set of weights are defined that produces a desired response as a reaction to certain input patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>¥</head><p>There are two main techniques for the learning phase: supervised learning and non-supervised learning. In supervised learning the function is learned from samples which a "teacher" supplies. This set of samples, referred to as the training set, contains elements which consist of paired values of the independent (input) variable and the dependent (output) variable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>¥</head><p>In the case of non-supervised learning, it reaches an internal model that captures the regularity in the inputs without taking other information into account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Basis functions</head><p>A linear model for a function ¢ ¡ ¤ £ ¦ ¥ can be expressed in the following form</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">¥ : ¢ ¡ ¤ £ ¥ ¡ ¢ £ ¤ ¦ ¥ § ¤ © ¤ ¡ ¤ £ ¦ ¥ (1)</formula><p>The model is expressed as a linear combination of a set of m fixed functions, often referred to as basis functions. The flexibility of , its ability to fit many different functions, derives only from the freedom to choose different values for the weights. The basis functions and any parameters which they might contain are fixed. If the basis function parameters can also change during the learning process, the model is considered non-linear. Any set of functions can be used as a basis set, although it is desirable that they are differentiable. There are many different classes of functions that one can use as basis functions, for example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Fourier series ¡£ ¥ ¡ ! # " % $ © &amp; ' ( ) ¡£ 1 0 3 2 ¥ 4 5<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Logistic functions ¡£ ¥ </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Gaussian ¡ ¤ £ ¦ ¥ ¡ 8 @ 9 A " 0 ¡ ¤ £ 1 0 F ¥ ¢ G ¢ 5 (4) Multiquadratic ¡£ ¥ ¡ ¡ G ¢ 7 ¡£ ' 0 F ¥¢ G (5)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Radial basis function networks</head><p>Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFn) are derived from the exact interpolation problem ¦ by introduction of several changes.</p><p>The exact interpolation problem attempts to map every input point exactly onto a corresponding target point. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) approach introduces a set of basis functions equal to the number of input points. Furthermore, the following modifications are necessary for the introduction of RBFns:</p><p>The number of basis functions does not have to be the same as the number of input points, and is typically smaller.</p><p>The bias parameters are included in the sum term of the linear model from equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>.</p><p>In the case of a non-linear model there are two more modifications if the basis function can move, change size, or if there is more than one hidden layer:</p><p>There is no constraint that the centers of basis functions have to be input points; instead, determining these centers is part of the training process.</p><p>Instead of a unique parameter </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Linear network models</head><p>In the case of a linear model, the parameters of the basis functions are fixed, and the goal is to minimize the sum of the squared errors in order to obtain the optimal weights vector ¥ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">¡ ¡ £ ¤ ¥ ¡ £ ¢ ¤ 0 ¢ ¡ ¤ £ ¤ ¥¥ ¢ ¥ ¤<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where ¦ is the pattern number, and ¡£ ¤ ¤ ¢ ¤ ¥ are the input and output vector targets of the respective training set.

In many cases this amounts to an over-fitting problem, and the main effect of this is that the neural network loses its generalization capacity. In order to counter the effects of over-fitting it is possible to utilize results from regularization theory. Regularization theory suggests to attach a term called regularization parameter in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(6)</ref>, in order to obtain a weight vector which is more robust against noise in the training set. In regularization theory, there are two main techniques: global ridge regression, where one uses unique regularization parameters for all basis functions, and local ridge regression, where there is a regularization parameter for every basis function. For the case of global ridge regression one has to modify equation (6) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">¡ ¡ £ ¤ ¥ ¡ £ ¢ ¤ 0 ¢ ¡ ¤ £ ¤ ¥ ¥ ¢ 7 ¢ £ ¤ ¦ ¥ § ¢ ¤ ¤ (8)</formula><p>where m is the basis function index.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Forward selection</head><p>One way to give linear models the flexibility of non-linear models is to go through a process of selecting a subset of basis functions from a larger set of candidates. </p><p>and, in the case of local ridge regression, the cost function <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(9)</ref> is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">¡ ¢ D ¥ ¢<label>(12)</label></formula><p>A good measure of model performance is its variance.

This involves a particular form of the covariance matrix, which consists of a triangular and a diagonal matrix; this fact can be used to greatly accelerate the computation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Non-linear network models</head><p>In the non-linear model the basis function parameters are not fixed, and it is possible to estimate them during the learning process.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Our algorithm</head><p>In this section we present our algorithm in pseudo code format, followed by a brief explanation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Results</head><p>The first step in our research was to find a good learning algorithm to train the RBFn function with small training sets. In order to do this we evaluated different learning algorithms in the following order: first linear models with forward selection without and with local ridge regression (GCV,¢ UVE,£ FPE, BIC ¤ ¢ ) ; we used the Matlab implementation of these algorithms by</p><p>Orr.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>¥</head><p>Then we considered nonlinear models as proposed by Lee £ and Carozza § ; we implemented these ourselves in C.</p><p>Our proposed own non-linear model was again implemented in Matlab. All these algorithms were then compared to multiple polynomial regression and tetrahedral interpolation.</p><p>When we wanted to find out whether a particular learning algorithm is adequate to solve the posed problem, we first tested it only for the conversion CMY¨CIELAB on an Epson Stylus Pro5000, and only if this preliminary test turned out favourably,</p><p>we conducted further experiments on other printers and with the conversion CIELAB¨CMY. In every table of the columns for the training and test sets we show the average error on the left and the maximum error on the right of the respective cells.</p><p>We began the experiments by initially testing existing learning algorithms, specifically those proposed by <ref type="bibr">Golub</ref> Our results demonstrate that this model is already able to improve on the performance of multiple polynomial regression for polynomials with up to 60 terms and tetrahedral interpolation, shown in table 3, in the case of the set Training1. However, this</p><p>does not extend to the set Training2, where the unmodified RBFn approach fares no better than the conventional techniques. This is probably due to the fact that in this case the network encounters over-fitting problems as mentioned in section 3.4. In order to resolve this problem we have tried to use regularization theory (local and global ridge regression), but this failed to improve the results. These results are shown in the table 2.</p><p>Another approach was to generate more training sets with smaller numbers of samples compared to the original large set Training1. We produced two such sets in the way suggested by Moroni, In this phase of the experiments we also tried other innovative learning algorithms found in literature (such as Lee £ and Carozza § ), but the results we obtained were of poor quality. We then altered our strategy and decided to modify an existing learning algorithm. Our the choice here has been to modify the learning algorithm proposed by Carozza, § mainly because it does not get significantly more complex when it is modified, and also because it does not have inherent convergence problems like the algorithm of Lee. The results show how it is possible to obtain performance that is better than that of multiple polynomial regression and tetrahedral interpolation with only 125 samples. This is shown in the last two columns beginning at the right of  <ref type="table">and in table 11</ref> for the Olivetti Artjet20. The data is also compared against results from multiple polynomial regression; all tests were done for the function CMY¨CIELAB.</p><p>The results show that there is an improvement over multiple polynomial regression for every ink-jet color printer. The results shown in the tables 9 to 11 demonstrate that our model has general validity.</p><p>The final problem we discuss in this paper is the definition of the function CIELAB¨CMY using our model; now the main problem is that of the definition of a suitable termination condition for the learning process. If we use the same condition that we used for the definition of the function CMY¨CIELAB and compute the error in CIELAB space, is necessary to use the inverse transformation for each termination check, which in turn also implies that a neural network for this inverse case ought to be used. This solution is not feasible because the computational cost of the inverse network training phase is significant, and too much accuracy is lost through the repeated conversions. Neither is it possible to compute the error in CMY space, because this approach is inherently incapable of knowing when to stop the learning process.</p><p>The solution that we have adopted has been to generate a LUT with 729 uniform samples in CMY space with our type of RBF network, which was trained with 125 samples. We then used this LUT with multiple polynomial regression on the set Test. We compared this result to the result obtained with a LUT of 729 uniform samples, which were printed and measured from CMY space, and which were also used with multiple polynomials regression on the same set of samples. The results are reported in table 12; this test was performed on an ink-jet printer of the type Epson Stylus Pro5000.</p><p>These results show that is possible to generate a LUT from only 125 initial printed and measured samples with our method, compared to 729 samples used by multiple polynomial regression or interpolation models. Our model permits a fast recharacterization of ink-jet color printers because it needs only 125 printed and measured samples, and in addition its training phase is very fast. On a 500 MHz Pentium II Celeron system with 128 Mbytes of RAM the training time with the initial 125 samples is in the order of a few minutes, and the time it takes to generate the 729 entry LUT is one additional minute.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We have presented a new learning algorithm, which is a modification of a known technique, that trains the RBFn model for the colorimetric characterization of color printers. Our algorithm needs a training set of only 125 samples in order to train the RBFn. With this model is even possible to generate a LUT of 729 samples, beginning with only 125 printed and measured samples, and to use this LUT with other standard algorithms of colorimetric characterization.</p><p>The computational cost is very low in the training and testing phases, and is even better than the performance of other standard colorimetric characterization models (multidimensional polynomials regression an tetrahedral interpolation). It is our opinion that the results suggest that may be possible to use this algorithm in consumer products, because we have been able to resolve the two problems that has so far limited the more widespread use of such methods: high computational cost, and the large number of training samples needed. The small size of the training set also permits a fast recharacterization of devices.</p><p>We believe that there are several possible ways to evolve these models for colorimetric characterization problems: investigation of different mathematical models for the estimation of the basis function parameters, research on different mathematical models for the estimation of the weights, introduction of one or two more hidden layers in the structure of the RBFn, and eventually experiments that involve combinations of these new techniques.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>¥</head><label></label><figDesc>Neural networks consist of collections of connected formal neurons.

The pseudoinverse method works by resolving the following general system of linear equations: three dimensional space of the input and output vectors. In this equation there appears a of the linear system (27), throught the pseudo inverse matrix, is the matrix § different methods to resolve the linear system (27): Gauss-Jordan elimination, Gaussian elimination with Backsubstitution, LU decomposition and Singular value decomposition (SVD) etc. We used the SVD method because in comparision with the other methods it gives satisfactory results and is a most fast algorithm. £ Let take a general matrix . This method is based on the following theorem of linear algebra: three different cases, about the form of the matrix :In the case the matrix is square, square matrices of the same size.Their inverse are also trivial to compute, in fact ¤ and § are orthogonal, so their inverses are equal to their transposes. Instead ¥ is diagonal, so its inverse is the diagonal matrix whose elements are the reciprocals of the element¨¤ . In this way the inverse of the matrix is:</figDesc></figure>

In this case is possible to augment your left-hand side matrix with rows of zeros underneath its nonzero rows, untill it is filled up to be square, square and we can apply the SVD in the way explained for the square matrix, equation (32). If there are more equations than unknowns, we are in the case of overdeterminated set of linear equations, and the equation for the square case, equation (32), can be apply without modification. The output of the network trained with our model is not calculated as in the model proposed by Carozza, § but rather by a sum of products of basis function output weights. The RBFn model used in our experiments adopts only one hidden layer, and three dimensional Gaussian basis functions for the nodes in the hidden layer with the same variance G . In our model there are some parameters: the average F and the variance G for the basis function, the weights § , times as the number of epochs and as initial error. Other initializations depend on the application at hand. After preliminary experiments, we choose the following values to be suitable for our particular case:</figDesc></figure>

Results from test runs with these sets are reported in table 6, for multiple polynomial regression, instead for RBFn linear models with forward selection without local ridge regression, and with local ridge regression in the tables 4 and 5 respectively. These results show that there are indeed improvements with respect to multiple polynomial regression with the set Training3, and equal performance with Training4. However, compared to the still large size of the new reduced training sets the improvement is rather small. The methodology for generation of the condensed training set proposed by Moroni ¡ apparently does not allow for the desired increase in efficiency.</figDesc></figure>

However, their approach also has some disadvantages: the need for a big training set (several hundred to several thousand samples), high computational cost, and a comparatively large maximum color error for high quality color reproductions. One of these problems has been solved by Artusi, Campadelli and Schettini ¢ : in their work they reduced the size of the training set to 216 measured samples, while retaining a maximum error that is comparable to -in some cases even better than -previous approaches.There are no references to be found in the literature about the use of radial basis function networks for the colorimetric characterization of printers, but there is a wealth of other publications about them and their applications (such as Orr,The work we present is novel in seven ways: to begin with, this is the first work that uses radial basis function networks to resolve the colorimetric characterization of printers. Second, we used a new learning model to train such networks; our approach is based on a modification of the proposal by Carozza. § Third, we use only 125 measured samples for the training of the network. Fourth, the computational costs for this training are very low when compared to previous techniques and allow to use this model in consumer products. Fifth, it is a general model which one can also use to define other transformations between color spaces. Sixth, it is possible to have a fast recharacterization of the device because the computational cost of the training phase is low. Finally, it improves on the performance of multiple polynomial regression and tetrahedral interpolation.</figDesc><table>propose the application of neural networks and polynomial regression.
