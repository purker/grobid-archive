<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Shape analysis is a static program analysis technique that approximates the structure of the runtime heap. It is closely related to pointer alias analysis but has its focus on the heap with dynamically allocated, recursive data structures. Using shape analysis results, many questions about the runtime heap can be answered at compile time. Such information is crucial to finding software bugs or to verify high-level correctness properties.</p><p>Various analyses have been introduced but their relative quality in terms of precision often remains unclear as analyses cannot be compared directly due to different representations of analysis results.</p><p>The aim of our work is to compare parametrized versions of shape analyses by the size of may-alias sets extracted from shape analysis results. Smaller sets of possible aliases are more precise and indicate a more precise underlying shape analysis. We are thus able to experimentally evaluate precision and analysis runtime tradeoffs for parametrized versions of shape analysis algorithms that use different heap representations.</p><p>Parametrized versions of the state-of-the-art graphbased shape analyses, SRW <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and NNH <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, were implemented for C++ using the SATIrE program analysis framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Measurements using the aforementioned metric show the relative quality of analyses and the impact analysis parameters have on precision and runtime. We are the first to show that the NNH shape analysis is strictly more precise than SRW. Experimental results allow us to make recommendations concerning the combination of analysis parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CONTRIBUTIONS</head><p>We implemented multiple instances of state-of-the-art graph-based shape analyses for a subset of the C++ programming language and developed an algorithm based on three-valued logic that extracts alias information from shape graphs.</p><p>Using this algorithm as a metric indicating the precision of the underlying shape analysis we are able to judge the effects of individual analysis parameters on runtime and precision of the analyses.</p><p>In detail, the contributions address theory, practice, and assessment of shape analyses:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. THEORY</head><p>We extended both the SRW <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and the NNH <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> shape analysis algorithms to model information flows from function call sites to matching function bodies (interprocedural). In their original formulation the analyses were intra-procedural.</p><p>We adapted the graph-based shape analyses from theoretical programming languages to a subset of C++.</p><p>We developed an algorithm for alias extraction from shape graphs based on the technique described in Reps et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Our algorithm improves precision in all cases where objects in the heap are linked with two or more indirections, e. g., linked lists with two or more elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. PRACTICE</head><p>We implemented the shape analyses and integrated them into the SATIrE program analysis framework where subsequent program analyses can now use them as powerful alias analyses.</p><p>We added automatic annotation of shape-and alias analysis results to SATIrE. The results obtained by the analyses are available as annotations to the SATIrE abstract syntax tree, as annotations to a program's source code, or as graphical visualization of a program's control flow graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. ASSESSMENT</head><p>We evaluated shape analysis abstractions and discovered that SRW shape analyses cannot contain must-alias information. We found that the SRW algorithm does not always perform a strong update. Both findings were not previously published.</p><p>We systematically introduced five parameters to the shape-based alias analyses to thoroughly evaluate their effects on precision and runtime: (1) shape analysis algorithm, (2) inter-procedural context information, (3) retaining temporary variables, (4) "common tails" extension, and (5) lazy/extensive alias testing. This results in 32 variations of shape-based alias analyses for our comparison.</p><p>Interpreting the observed results we were able to make recommendations concerning the combination of analysis parameters:</p><p>-Ignoring context information produced the worst results and took the most time -always use context information for shape analyses. -We showed that the SRW shape analysis with an extensive alias test cannot be more precise than the lazy test on SRW graphs -always perform the lazy test for the SRW analysis results to save time. -NNH shape analysis and the lazy alias test produce a poor match: analysis runtimes are always longer than with SRW but only in one case is the result (minimally) more precise; the higher precision gained from NNH (and paid for by the longer analysis runtime) is lost in the lazy alias test as it merges separate execution paths before the test which were deliberately kept apart during analysis. -Without temporary variables or the "common tail" extension, SRW and NNH have comparable precision but SRW is roughly 5 times faster on our test cases. -Retaining temporary variables increased precision for both SRW and NNH (23% and 21% smaller alias sets, respectively) but also increased graph sizes and therefore analysis runtime (3 times)here, the precision is expensive. -The "common tails" alias test increased precision only in combination with NNH, but then at no measurable increased cost -a cheap precision increase for an already precise analysis.</p><p>The number of may-aliases computed from the SRWor NNH shape analysis results is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. A more detailed discussion can be found in the first author's thesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In summary, we can say:</p><p>-NNH is strictly more precise than SRW in all observed test cases -The fastest variant is: SRW, with context information, with lazy alias test, without common tails, without temporary variables -If more precision is required: NNH, with context information, with extensive alias test, with common tails. Using our proposed metric we observed a 28% gain in precision (reduced alias set sizes) at 36 times increased runtime for our test cases. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Our work was the first to implement the NNH shape analysis algorithm. We extended state-of-the-art graph-based shape analyses to be used inter-procedurally on a subset of C++ and improved the precision of the established algorithm to extract alias information from shape graphs. Our work features the first comparison of the relative merits of the two state-of-the-art graph-based shape analyses termed SRW and NNH. We were thus able to answer a theoretically and practically important question, as to which is the more precise shape analysis, which was open since 1999.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Number of May-Aliases computed from SRWand NNH shape analysis results (fewer may-aliases are more precise).</figDesc></figure>
