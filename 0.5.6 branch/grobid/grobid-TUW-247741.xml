<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Evaluating the quality of segmentations is an important process in image processing, especially in the medical domain. Many evaluation metrics have been used in evaluating segmentation. There exists no formal way to choose the most suitable metric(s) for a particular segmentation task and/or particular data. In this paper we propose a formal method for choosing the most suitable metrics for evaluating the quality of segmentations with respect to ground truth segmentations. The proposed method depends on measuring the bias of metrics towards/against the properties of the the segmentations being evaluated. We firstly demonstrate how metrics can have bias towards/against particular properties and then we propose a general method for ranking metrics according to their overall bias. We finally demonstrate for 3D medical image segmentations that ranking produced using metrics with low overall bias strongly correlate with manual rankings done by an expert.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1 Introduction 1.1 The need to understand metrics: Many evaluation metrics for image segmentation have been introduced; most researchers choose the evaluation metrics arbitrarily or according to their popularity. Investigating metrics would help researchers to better understand them and help companies and stakeholders to save effort and time reaching optimal systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A poorly defined metric may lead to inaccurate conclusions like selecting suboptimal models when comparing the performance of classifiers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Many researchers have investigated the drawbacks of particular metrics given particular properties of the data being classified. As a special case of classification, image segmentation is also affected by these drawbacks. The following are some examples: Hausdorff distance is very sensitive to noise and least squares based evaluation methods are very sensitive to outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Mutual information doesn't utilize spatial information inherited in images because only voxel relationships are considered but not the neighborhoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Information theoretical measures have a non-convergent baseline which depends on the ratio between the number of data points and the number of classes. Therefore this class of measure needs chance correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Commonly used measures (precision, recall and F-measures) are biased and don't consider the level of chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Choosing evaluation metrics is very important and application-dependent; when evaluating imbalanced datasets, the metric choice is not obvious <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Metrics have different properties with respect to their correlation with user satisfaction criteria and their ease of interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Benhabiles et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> validated 250 automatic segmentations against their corresponding ground truth segmentations using four different evaluation metrics. The results were then compared with manual ratings from 40 human observers. They found that the correlations between the ranking based on the manual ratings and the rankings based on the evaluation metrics vary between 30% and 80% depending on the used metric.</p><p>Research in the last decades generally results in the relative system improvement achieved becoming smaller and smaller. As a result, sensitivity and fidelity of evaluation metrics become increasingly critical. When improvements are small, metrics with high sensitivity are needed to measure small but real improvements and also with high fidelity to distinguish between improvements based on user preferences and improvements resulting from biased relevance judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> [10].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Problem definition and notations:</head><p>In this paper, we propose a formal method for selecting the most suitable metrics to evaluate image segmentation depending on the data being segmented and the goal of the segmentation task. The method is primarily based on two facts: the first is that effectiveness metrics can be biased towards or against properties of the images being segmented, meaning that particular metrics over-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The second fact is that selecting the best evaluation metrics can be subject to the segmentation goal which means that the bias towards/against a particular property of the data can be differently important depending on the segmentation goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. To meet the context dependency, the proposed method allows individual weighting of the influence of each property according to its importance in case this is known, which increases the effectiveness of the method.</p><p>The problem to be solved in this paper can be formulated as follows: given a set of metrics M = {M 1 , M2, ..., M r }, a set of image segmentations C = {C 1 , C 2 , ...., C k }, then the task is to rank the metrics in M according to their suitability for evaluating the quality of the segmentations in C provided that for each segmentation there exists a ground truth segmentation.</p><p>The proposed method is general and can be applied to select evaluation metrics for all types of segmentations. However, for simplicity, we will consider only the crisp segmentation task in this paper to present and formulate the method. In particular, we will be analyzing and testing the method using a special type of segmentation, namely medical volume segmentation e.g. magnetic resonance images (MRI) where voxels (3D pixels) are either assigned or not to a given class (segment) e.g. an organ or a tumor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Jin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> established a formal method for comparing two different measures and introduced two criteria for formal comparison of the goodness of evaluation metrics, namely the degree of consistency (DoC) and degree of discriminancy (DoD). Applying these criteria, they showed theoretically and empirically that AUC is a better measure than accuracy in evaluating the performance of classifiers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> applied formal constraints based on axiometry to compare and judge evaluation metrics depending on the grade of satisfaction of these constraints. Busin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> used axiometrics to define a formal and general notation that fits any effectiveness metric. Based on this notation, they proposed several axioms that should be satisfied by an effectiveness metric. They used these axioms as criteria to evaluate metrics. All these papers deal with the problem only from a theoretical axiometrical point of view without taking into account the classification goal and the nature and properties of data being classified.</p><p>Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed a method for evaluating evaluation metrics by measuring their sensitivity using Bootstrap Hypothesis Tests, and used this method in com-paring seven evaluation metrics. They negate the belief that commonly used evaluation measures are equally reliable. Fatourechi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> proposed a framework based on Desired Region of Operation (DROP) for selecting the best evaluation metric for evaluating imbalanced classifications. Sakai <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> provided comparisons between metrics depending on the sensitivity and stability using the Voorhees/Buckley swap method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. All these papers lack generality because they are methods designed either for specific metrics or for specific metric properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Proposed Methods</head><p>We propose a method for choosing the most suitable metric for evaluating image segmentation. In Sections 3.1 to 3.3, the method is described and discussed formally. Then this formal description is explained in a step by step demonstration with a real example in Section 4, which also provides an experimental evaluation of the method.</p><p>Given a set of effectiveness metrics M and a set of segmentations C, each of the segmentations is evaluated against its ground truth segmentation using all metrics to obtain a ranking per metric. Now, choosing the most suitable metric goes in two main steps: (i) Constructing different partitions on the segmentation set C and ranking the subsets of each partition according to their average quality regarding each metric. (ii) Inferring the metric bias from the rank correlations across all partitions and all metrics. In the following, each of the steps is described in more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Constructing partitions and rank structure:</head><p>1. For each metric m ∈ M, evaluate each of the segmentations x ∈ C against its ground truth segmentation to get the score matrix s where s(x, m) is the score of segmentation x measured by metric m.</p><p>2. For each metric m ∈ M, assign each segmentation x ∈ C a rank depending on its score to get the rank matrix r where r(x, m) is the rank of segmentation x measured by metric m. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Define a set</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">P ij (x) = 1 x ∈ subset j of partition i 0 otherwise<label>(1)</label></formula><p>5. Construct t random partitionsP = {P 1 , ..,P t } by randomly assigning segmentations to s equal subsets in each partition. The functionP ij (x) that assigns a segmentation x to the subset j of the random partition i is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P ij (x) = 1 x ∈ subset j of random partition i 0 otherwise<label>(2)</label></formula><p>6. For each metric m ∈ M, for each partition i ∈ P, rank the subsets j according to the average of the individual ranks in each subset using the rank function</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">s mi (j) = ( ∑ P ij (x)=1 r(m, x))/n ij<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where x ∈ C are the individual segmentations and n ij is the number of segmentations in the subset j of Partition i. Now, use the rank averages from Equation 3 to compute the rank structure R = R(i, j, m) that gives the rank of subset j of partition i measured by metric m according to descending rank average. Analogously,Ř =Ř(i, j, m) gives the rank of subset j of the random partition i measured by metric m. Note that ranking the subsets using the averages of the individual ranks in each subset is a ranking method inspired by the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. This is because straightforwardly computing the ranks from score averages is sensitive to outliers and may produce unreasonable rankings if the scores are not normally distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Inferring metric bias:</head><p>Now, the rank structuresŘ (rankings of the random partitions) and R (rankings of the non-random partitions) provide a statistical basis to infer metric bias by analyzing how rankings of the different metrics and different partitions are correlated. The analysis is primarily based on comparing two correlations: the average of the rank correlations given the random partitionsŘ (we will call this correlation the base correlationǨ) and the rank correlation given a particular partition R (we will call this correlation the biased correlation K). They are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K(m t ) = 1 |P|.|M| ∑ i∈P ∑ m∈M r[Ř(i, ., m t ),Ř(i, ., m)] (4) K(m t , p) = 1 |M| ∑ m∈M r[R(p, ., m t ), R(p, ., m)] (5)</formula><p>where m t is the metric being evaluated, p is a given <ref type="figure">partition, and r(x1, x2)</ref> is the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the rankings x1 and x2 (the point denotes all possible values, e.g. R(p, ., m) means all possible subset ranks in partition p measured by metric m) Now, we define the overall bias of metric m t to be the average of the absolute correlation change B(m t ) which is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">B(m t ) = 1 |P| ∑ i∈P abs[K(m t , i) −Ǩ(m t )]<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Finally, the metrics in M are ranked according to their overall bias, where the metric with the lowest bias is the most suitable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion:</head><p>To understand the key idea, let's think about the following two cases: Case 1, partitioning the segmentations randomly. Case 2, partitioning the segmentations according to a particular property (e.g. class imbalance in the underlying segmentations). Given a particular metric m, the base correlationǨ(m) given by Equation 4 (related to Case 1) depends on the nature of the metric and is not affected by the properties of the segmentations, since the partition is random. Now, if this correlation changes when we consider Case 2 (i.e. biased correlation K given by Equation 5), then the change is caused by the impact of the property used for partitioning (in this case class imbalance) on the metric and therefore it characterizes the bias of the metric towards/against this property. If many partitions (many properties) are used, then the sum of the correlation differences is a measure of the overall bias for the given metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In this section, the proposed method is demonstrated and tested with a real example, namely a set of 229 automatic brain tumor segmentations (MRI 3D volumes) from the BRATS2012 challenge 1 . The segmentations correspond to 47 medical cases and were produced by five different algorithms participating in BRATS challenge. To build the rank structure (described in Section 3.1), all segmentations were evaluated against their ground truth segmentations using 18 metrics (listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) to get the score matrix s (Step 1). Then global ranks were calculated from scores to get a ranking per metric r (Step 2). A set of 7 properties, namely segment size, noise, class imbalance, connected component count, point variance, sphereness, and recall, was defined (Step 3). Now, 7 partitions of the segmentations were constructed each time using one of the defined properties. Each consists of 10 subsets with <ref type="bibr">229</ref> 10 ≈ 22 segmentations (Step 4). A random partition with 10 equal subsets was constructed (Step 5). For each partition, the subsets were ranked using the sum of individual global ranks r to get 18 rankings per partition (126 rankings in total). The random partition was also ranked to get 18 rankings (Step 6). To infer metric bias, Equations 4, 5, and 6 in Section 3.2 were applied to the resulting rank structure. The result of this step is a metric list ranked according to bias.</p><p>To validate the suitability ranking produced by the proposed approach, a manual ranking done by a radiology expert was used: for each medical case, the five corresponding segmentations were ranked by their quality from a medical point of view (we call these the manual rankings). Analogously, for each medical case, 18 rankings of the five segmentations were produced each time using one of metrics (we call these the metric rankings). The average correlation between manual rankings and metric rankings was computed for each metric and finally the metrics were sorted according to this average correlation. The resulting metric ranking <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref> column 'manual') was used as a ground truth suitability ranking of the metrics to validate the automatic ranking. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> column 'automatic' contains for each metric the bias (Equation 6) and the corresponding suitability rank computed according to ascending bias. A moderate to strong correlation between the two rankings can be observed. The six best metrics are the same in both rankings. This correlation shows that metrics with low bias produce rankings that are more correlated to manual rankings than others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and future work</head><p>For evaluating segmentations, metrics can be chosen according to their bias (Equation 6) toward/against the properties of the segmentations being evaluated. Test results show that the ranking produced by metrics with low bias generally have higher correlation with manual ranking than rankings produced by other metrics. In future work, the method will be tested with seg-  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Manual and automatic metric suitability rankings. In column 'manual', the average correlation between metric rankings and the manual rankings as well as corresponding suitability ranks according to decending correlation. In column 'automatic', the metric bias calculated automatically by the proposed method as well as the ranks according to ascending bias (detailed data and results available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>) mentations of other types and validated against rankings from different experts. A further issue to be investigated in future work is the influence of weighting the properties in Equation 6 on the metric suitability ranking, if it is known that particular properties are more/less important for the segmentation goal. For example, the manual ranking used to validate this method is done by a radiologist who may emphasise recall on cost of precision to assure that the tumor is completely removed. In this case weighting the recall and precision properly could improve the result.</p></div>
