  <title>A Critical Incident from an AAL Project: Choosing the services to include</title>
  <note>1</note>
  <abstractText>This position paper describes a critical incident from an early AAL project related to the design decisions made about which features to include. In order to give the older users of a sensor-based telecare monitoring system more tangible value, a number of non-sensor-based interactive services were incorporated into the system which was installed in a residential facility. These services were chosen based on recommendations and input from older people. In the end though, many services were not used and actually contributed to the system being removed from residences. willing to invest money. They also received some national funding for later development steps.</abstractText>
