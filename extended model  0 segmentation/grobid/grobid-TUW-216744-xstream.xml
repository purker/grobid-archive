  <abstractText>Medical practitioners often have unmet information needs that impact patient care. However, currently available web-based search engines are not suitable for routine use. Finding relevant information takes too long, assessing the trustworthiness of found information is difficult, and support for the heterogeneity of languages and nomenclature across European countries is lacking. In this paper, we analyze the current barriers to web-based searching by medical practitioners and introduce the European Khresmoi project, which aims to dismantle these barriers. 1. Background Physicians often have unmet information needs. These have been reported as occurring for up to 2 of every 3 patients seen [1], or more recently for 41% of the questions they pursued [2]. Although these medical professionals have many tools for information search available (such as PubMed), studies have revealed that they do not use them to their full capabilities. Most questions arise during consultations and have a direct impact on the medical decision process [3]. There is evidence suggesting that physicians primarily respond to their information needs when they perceive the question to be urgent and believe that definitive answers can be found [4]. However, physicians are often restricted in their search by time constraints [5]. Physicians search on average for less than 5 minutes to answer questions [6]. A so-called &quot;90 second rule&quot; has been described in the literature-meaning physicians do not even attempt to find information unless they think they can do it in a minute and a half [7]. Hence, it is important that the pertinent information is found during this time. However, the time taken to answer questions using PubMed averages 30 minutes [1] and the information found is often scattered over multiple articles, making PubMed searching impractical for routine clinical use [6]. Furthermore, physicians that are not native English speakers using systems in English language are prone to use erroneous search terms, resulting in poorer returned results [8]. The World Wide Web has a lot to offer in terms of both quantity and quality of medical information [9]. There is no consensus within the literature as to what extent doctors currently rely on web-based searching as compared to other information sources. One line of research suggests that physicians often find it quicker and easier to look up answers in a pocket reference book or ask a colleague for advice [10] rather than searching on the Internet. In addition current web-based solutions fail to provide psychological support, guidance, affirmation, sympathy, judgement, and feedback, which colleagues can provide within the daily decision making process of a physician. A review by Davies [3] compared relevant research between 2000 and 2005, and found that text books (39%) and colleagues (25%) were the information sources physicians accessed most frequently, while computer resources were used only by 13%. However, an upward trend of Internet use is visible as the highest percentage of use examined in the study, 53%, occurred in the latest published research from 2005. A Spanish study published in 2007 [11] found that the majority of physicians still relied on colleagues, drug compendiums and textbooks rather than on web-based resources. A possible explanation is language as a potential barrier to web-based searching, and it appears to be inadequately addressed by current web-based solutions within the medical domain. In contrast to these findings is research claiming a clear preference of the Internet as a primary informational resource amongst physicians [12],[13]. Both studies provide support for the notion that the Internet has become an important information source amongst physicians. Possible explanations of conflicting study outcomes could be the variance among medical specialities, different geographical locations and potential biases introduced by different methodologies used in the studies (e.g., user observations versus self reports). Furthermore, the rapid changes and advances in the field of information technology make comparisons over larger time spans difficult. There is also conflicting data about which web sites and tools physicians use to look for medical information on the web. Some publications suggest that general-purpose search services such as Google can play a useful role in the medical decision making process [14],[15]. In contrast, Leo et. al. [16] reported that physicians mistrust the quality of results from such search engines and prefer to directly access specialized medical websites. A study by Yu and Kaufman [14] suggests that Google is preferred for finding medical definitions, as it is easy to use and provides good answers to simple questions. However, for more complex information needs more advanced search systems may be required. A recent study funded by Google [13] is in strong contrast with prior findings. It postulates that the majority of physicians use Google or a similar search engine as their primary information sources in the clinical decision making process. However, it is unclear as to what extent the study was biased in terms of sample selection. Another study showed that general practitioners use Google as their first information source, primarily to lead them to higher quality websites [17]. Thus, it appears that physicians are currently willing to use a search engine for simple questions and as an initial source to help them find their way to higher quality websites.</abstractText>
