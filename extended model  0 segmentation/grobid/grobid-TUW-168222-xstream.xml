  <title>Optimization of communication by analyzing the interlocutor&apos;s wording</title>
  <abstractText>Recent research results on communication science mention a relation between the inter-locutor&apos;s perceptional preferences, his or her mental representations and his or her choice of expressions. However, there is not any tool for analyzing such. In my research I combined lexical with computational linguistic methods to develop a software prototype that is able to analyze text on the usage of perceptional expressions. This analyzing tool can help to identify the interlocutor&apos;s perceptional preference for easier meeting his or her way of thinking and thereby facilitate the understanding. Still, for the German language, not much research on the relation between an individual&apos;s perceptional preference and his or her language use has been done yet. To be able to go deeper into that idea, (1) a lexical corpus of perceptional expressions and (2) a software tool that automatically filters those expressions from a text are needed. Those two steps shall be explained in this abstract.</abstractText>
