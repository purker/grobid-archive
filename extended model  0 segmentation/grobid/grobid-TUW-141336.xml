				<p>The QXOR-SAT problem is the quantified version of the satisfiability problem XOR-SAT in which the connective exclusive-or is used instead of the usual or. We study the phase transition associated with random QXOR-SAT instances. We give a description of this phase transition in the case of one alternation of quantifiers, thus performing an advanced practical and theoretical study on the phase transition of a quantified problem.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">QXOR, XOR and the Maximal rank Property</head><p>In this section, we relate QXOR and XOR to the Maximal rank property. We start with some definitions and notations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Notation</head><p>An e-XOR-clause, C, is a linear equation over the finite field GF (2) using exactly e distinct variables, C = ((x 1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ x e ) = ε) where ε = 0 or 1.</p><p>An e-XOR-formula, ϕ, is a conjunction of not necessarily distinct e-XOR-clauses. A truth assignment I is a mapping that assigns 0 or 1 to each variable in its domain, it satisfies e an XOR-clause C = ((x 1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ x e ) = ε) if and only if I(C) := I(x i ) mod 2 = ε and it i=1 satisfies a formula ϕ if and only if it satisfies every clause in ϕ.</p><p>We will denote by e-XOR-SAT the property for an e-XOR-formula of being satisfiable. An (a,e)-QXOR-formula is a closed quantified formula of the following type</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y ),</formula><p>where X and Y denote distinct set of variables, ϕ(X, Y ) is an (a + e)-XOR-formula such that each clause contains exactly a variables from X and exactly e variables from Y . Such a formula is true if, for every assignment to the variables X, there exists an assignment to the variables Y , such that ϕ is true. Observe that, for closed formulas, the notions of truth and satisfiability coincide. For this reason, we will use the two notions synonymously in the following. We denote by (a,e)-QXOR-SAT the property for an (a,e)-QXOR-formula of being true. Throughout the paper, we reserve m for the number of universal variables (resp. n for the number of existential variables), and {x 1 , . . . , x m } (resp. {y 1 , . . . , y n }) denotes the set of such variables. Note that there are</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">N = m a · n e · 2 (1)</formula><p>(a,e)-XOR-clauses. We consider random formulas ∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y ) obtained by choosing uni- formly independently and with replacement L clauses from all the possible N (a,e)-XOR- clauses. Using the terminology of <ref type="bibr">Chen and Interian (2005)</ref>, these formulas correspond to (a,e)-QXOR((m,n),L)-formulas. We are interested in estimating the probability that a randomly chosen (a,e)-QXOR((m,n),L)-formula is true. We denote this probability by Pr (m,n,L) ((a,e)-QXOR-SAT), or shortly Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) when no confusion can arise. When restricted to the non-quantified case, e-XOR-SAT, i.e., when a=0, we omit the first component in the subscript, thus discussing Pr n,L (e-XOR-SAT), or shortly Pr(e-XOR-SAT).</p><p>We will show that the behavior of the (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property is bounded from above and below by two monotone properties, namely the e-XOR-SAT property and the Maximal rank property. Experiments will suggest that the right parameter in order to study these properties is c, the ratio of the number of clauses over the number of existential vari- ables. Moreover, according to the results obtained for e-XOR-SAT by <ref type="bibr">Creignou, Daudé, and Dubois (2003)</ref>, we know that the transition occurs when c &lt; 1. Therefore, in the sequel we will always suppose without loss of generality that L ≤ n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Upper and Lower Bounds for the QXOR-SAT Property</head><p>Note that a random (a,e)-QXOR((m,n),L)-formula can also be considered as the quantified linear system</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∀X∃Y (AX + EY = C)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with coefficient arithmetic in GF (2), where A (respectively E) is a matrix chosen uniformly from the set of Boolean L × m (resp. L × n) matrices with exactly a (respectively e) units in each row, and C is a Boolean column vector of dimension L chosen uniformly from the set of all such vectors. Moreover, A, E and C are chosen independently.</p><p>Observe that the quantified linear system</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∀X∃Y (AX + EY = C)</formula><p>is consistent if and only if</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∀X (C − AX) ∈ Im(E),</formula><p>where Im(E) represents the image of the linear application whose matrix representation is E, that is Im(E) = {EY / Y ∈ {0, 1} n }. Hence the quantified linear system is consistent if and only if C ∈ Im(E) and Im(A) ⊆ Im(E). Therefore, we get:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) = Pr(∀X∃Y (AX + EY = C) is consistent)</formula><p>= Pr(C ∈ Im(E) and Im(A) ⊆ Im(E)).</p><p>Thus, on the one hand</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) ≤ Pr(C ∈ Im(E)) = Pr(e-XOR-SAT)</formula><p>holds, and on the other hand, the inequality</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) ≥ Pr(Im(E) = {0, 1} L )</formula><p>holds. Therefore, if Pr n,L (e-Max-rank) denotes the probability that a random matrix from the set of L × n Boolean matrices with e units per row is of maximal rank, then for every m ≥ a, all n and all L ≤ n, we get the following inequalities:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Pr n,L (e-Max-rank) ≤ Pr (m,n,L) ((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) ≤ Pr n,L (e-XOR-SAT).<label>(3)</label></formula><p>A natural question at this stage is to estimate the probability that a random matrix is of maximal rank. In the following we will provide some experiments and theoretical results comparing the behavior of the three properties, Maximal rank, QXOR-SAT and XOR-SAT, thus making precise the behavior of the (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property according to the value of e.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The Case e = 2</head><p>In this section, we restrict our attention to the case where all problems have two existential variables in each clause (and the number of all variables is allowed to vary).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental Results</head><p>In order to illustrate the inequalities (3) and to compare empirically the three properties, we discuss experiments that we have performed. In the experiments, all formulas are closed.  In all cases, the experiments have been conducted according to the same scheme. Let us describe it in detail for <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. One experiment consisted in generating at random (in drawing uniformly and independently) (1,2)-QXOR-formulas over 10 000 existential vari- ables and 10 000 universal variables with a ratio "number of clauses/number of existential variables" varying from 0.1 to 1 in steps of 0.05 or 0.1. For each of the chosen values of ratio, a sample of 1000 formulas were studied using the algorithm described in the work of <ref type="bibr">Creignou et al. (2001, chap. 6.4</ref>), thus deciding their truth (or satisfiability) as quantified formulas. The proportion of true instances for each considered value of ratio has been plot- ted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. The same has been done for the other (a,2)-QXOR-SAT properties. Hence, the different curves are independent from each other. For the 2-XOR-SAT experiment, we used the same selection procedure over 10 000 existential variables. Again, Gaussian elim- ination together with an examination of the quantifier structure were used to determine the logical "status" (true or false) of every formula. Additionally, it has been computed whether the matrix E has full rank or not. The curve 2-Max-rank shows the proportion of systems with full rank and it corresponds to the 2-XOR-SAT curve in the same <ref type="figure">figure.</ref> A close look at <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> reveals that some points from the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT curves are slightly below the (theoretical) lower bound given by the curve for 2-Max-rank. The reason for this phenomenon is the independence of all the satisfiability curves from each other and the "noise" induced by the finite sampling of problems. If we had chosen corresponding problems with exactly the same existential part (and only the universal part varies), then we would have got all satisfiability curves above the curve for 2-Max-rank.</p><p>The experimental results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> suggest first that the two bounding proper- ties, namely 2-Max-rank and 2-XOR-SAT are distinguishable, second that, when m = n, the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT property coincides asymptotically with the 2-Max-rank property indepen- dently of a ≥ 1, the number of universal variables per clause. At another scale for m, for instance when m is constant, the experimental results re- ported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> suggest that the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT property is in between the two prop- erties 2-Max-rank and 2-XOR-SAT.</p><p>In the following, we will validate the conjectures suggested by these experiments and prove that the property (a,2)-QXOR-SAT coincides asymptotically with the 2-Max-rank property as soon as m is tending to infinity with n, and that it is in between the 2-Max-rank property and the 2-XOR property when m is a fixed constant. In particular, we will make clear the connection between random (a,2)-QXOR-formulas and random labelled graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Bad Cycles and the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT Property</head><p>We are interested in the satisfiability of quantified systems of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">s = (∀X∃Y AX + EY = C),</formula><p>where E (respectively A) is a matrix chosen uniformly in the set of Boolean L × n (respec- tively L × m) matrices with exactly 2 (respectively a) units in each row, and C is a random column vector of dimension L, in which 0 and 1 occur with the same probability. The satis- fiability of such a system is strongly related to the existence of cycles in graphs. Indeed, we construct a graph G a (s) with n vertices and L weighted edges. For each existential variable y i we have a vertex in G a (s). For each equation y i ⊕ y j = x i 1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ x ia ⊕ ε, we add the edge {y i , y j } to G a (s) with the label x i 1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ x ia ⊕ ε. A cycle is given by a sequence of vertices (y i 1 , . . . , y is ) such that for 1 ≤ j ≤ s − 1, {y i j , y i j+1 } is an edge in the graph, and so is {y is , y i 1 }. The cycle is said to be elementary if all the vertices in the sequence are distinct. The weight of a cycle is the sum modulo 2 of the labels of its edges.</p><p>Example 3.1 Let X = {x 1 , x 2 , x 3 } and let Y = {y 1 , . . . , y 7 }. The formula ∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y ) with ϕ(X, Y ) being a conjunction of the following equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">y 1 ⊕ y 2 = x 1 y 1 ⊕ y 7 = x 2 y 2 ⊕ y 3 = x 3 y 2 ⊕ y 6 = x 2 ⊕ 1 y 3 ⊕ y 4 = x 2 ⊕ 1 y 3 ⊕ y 5 = x 3 y 4 ⊕ y 5 = x 3 ⊕ 1 y 6 ⊕ y 7 = x 1 ⊕ 1</formula><p>can be represented by the graph in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>In the following, we call a cycle bad when it has a nonzero weight, and good otherwise.</p><p>Example 3.2 In the graph associated with the formula described in the previous example, there is a good cycle, (y 1 , y 2 , y 6 , y 7 ), whose weight is 0, and a bad one, (y 3 , y 4 , y 5 ), whose weight is x 2 . For the latter cycle, the corresponding equations are y 3 ⊕ y 4 = x 2 ⊕ 1, y 3 ⊕ y 5 = x 3 , and y 4 ⊕ y 5 = x 3 ⊕ 1. Adding these three equations yields the equation 0 = x 2 which cannot be satisfied because x 2 ∈ X is universally quantified.</p><p>For systems containing only existential variables, i.e., a = 0, it has been observed by <ref type="bibr">Creignou and Daudé (2003)</ref> that a 2-XOR-formula is satisfiable if and only if the graph G 0 (s) has no bad cycle, that is :</p><p>Pr(2-XOR-SAT) = Pr(G 0 (s) has no bad cycle). Proof: Suppose we have an elementary cycle with nonzero weight in G a (s). Clearly, to such a cycle corresponds a subsystem in s, for which there exists an assignment to X such that no assignment to Y will satisfy it (see Example 3.2 for an illustration). Hence, s is unsatisfiable.</p><p>Conversely, suppose there is no (elementary) cycle with nonzero weight in G a (s). Take an arbitrary truth assignment I for the (universal) variables in X and apply it to G a (s). Since I(x) ∈ {0, 1} for all x ∈ X, the weight at each edge can be reduced to a constant from {0, 1} by addition modulo 2. Moreover, since each cycle in G a (s) has zero weight, the corresponding cycle in the "reduced" version, G ′ a (s), of G a (s) has also zero weight. The graph G ′ a (s) corresponds to a system with existential quantifiers only. In order to obtain a satisfying truth assignment for the existential variables, it suffices to apply the following procedure to each connected component of G ′ a (s). Consider an arbitrary root vertex y and assign an arbitrary truth value v to it. We obtain a truth value for each vertex in G ′ a (s) by performing a depth-first search starting from y. During the search, if there is an edge (y ′ , y ′′ ) labelled with ε and y ′′ has no truth value yet, then we set the value for y ′′ to the value of y ′ ⊕ ε. The assignment obtained in this way satisfies all the equations since G ′ a (s) does not contain any cycle with nonzero weight.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The Distribution Functions for 2-XOR-SAT and 2-Max-rank</head><p>In this section, we will give the exact asymptotical value of the bounds obtained in (3) in terms of the order parameter c, where c · n is the number of clauses. For this we will use well-known results from random graph theory. Let us recall that we consider the classical probabilistic model where each clause/edge is chosen uniformly and independently among the N = m a · n e · 2 possible ones. According to Proposition 1.13 in ( <ref type="bibr">Janson et al., 2000</ref>), if we choose L = c · n clauses, then this model is asymptotically equivalent to the one where each clause is drawn independently with probability p, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">1 + O(n −1/2 ) p = c · n m · n a 2 · 2</formula><p>holds. So, in the following, we will work with the random labelled graphs G a (s) associated with quantified systems s, with labelled edge probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">p = c n · m . a</formula><p>The corresponding probability is usually denoted by µ p .

This number converges in distribution to a Poisson law of parameter λ, where λ is the limit of the average number of cycles as n, the number of vertices, tends to infinity. This result can be easily extended to our model of labelled graphs. In particular,</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Pr(G a (s) has no (bad) cycle) −→ exp(−λ),</formula><p>where λ is the limit of the the average number of (bad) cycles. A challenging task is now to get a simple expression of lambda. Let Y be the random variable that counts the number of cycles. Let C be the set of all possible cycles. For any cycle c, we introduce the random variable X c such that X c (G a (s)) = 1 holds, if and only if G a (s) contains the cycle c. The average number of cycles is</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">E(Y ) = E( X c ) = E(X c ). c∈C c∈C</formula><p>Since every cycle c of length l has expectation E(X c ) = p l and since the number of cycles of length l is n(n − 1) . . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">(n − l + 1) 2l · m a l · 2 l , we get that E(Y ) = l · 2 l · p l l≥2 n(n − 1) . . .

In this particular case, the weight of a clause is either 0 or 1, which means that half of the cycles are bad. Thus, </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">λ 0 = lim n→+∞ l · 2 l−1 · p l = − 1 4 ln(1 − 2c) − c 2 .</formula><p>is established, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">1 H 0 (c) = exp(c/2) · (1 − 2c) 1/4 for 0 ≤ c ≤ 2 , 0</formula><p>otherwise.

Then, when n tends to infinity, the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT property has a coarse phase transition whose asymptotical distribution function can be expressed as a function depending on m.

Let λ m,a be the limit of the average number of bad cycles. We will give a closed expression of λ m,a . Observe that each label on the edges of the graph associated with a (a,2)-QXOR((m,n),cn)-formula is formed with a constant, 0 or 1, and a "variable-label" made of a universal variables. There are exactly m a such variable-labels, which are numbered from 1 to m a . One can decide whether a cycle is good or bad according to the number of 1 (even or odd) and the number of occurrences of each variable-label. Therefore it is quite natural to associate to every cycle its length l, the sequence <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(N 1 , .</ref> . . , N ( m a ) ) of the numbers of occurrences of each variable-label, and the parity ε = 0 or 1 of the number of occurrences of the constant 1. The limit of the average number of cycles whose parameter</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">(l, (N 1 , . . . , N ( m a ) ), ε) is fixed is l c l 2 l−1 2l · N 1 ,...,N ( m a ) m l . a</formula><p>Moreover, from such a parameter (l, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(N 1 , .</ref> . . , N ( m a ) ), ε), one can decide whether a cycle is bad or not.</p><p>For a better readability, let us focus on the case a = 1. In this particular case, the label of an edge is of the form x i ⊕ ε, where ε = 0 or 1 and 1 ≤ i ≤ m. On the one hand, all cycles of odd length are bad (for in the weight of such a cycle at least one of the coefficients of the x i 's will be nonzero). On the other hand, there are two kinds of cycles of even length that are bad. The ones in which the constant 1 appears an odd number of times, and the ones in which one of the universal variables appears an odd number of times.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Case e ≥ 3</head><p>It can be observed from the experimental results shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> that, contrary to what has been observed in the previous section, the three smooth lines connecting the con- secutive points and corresponding to the transition of the three properties 3-Max-rank, (a,3)-QXOR-SAT and 3-XOR-SAT are difficult to distinguish. Moreover, when n increases (see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>), the curves straighten and come closer one to each other, showing thus strong empirical evidence that the transitions of the three properties coincide asymptotically, with a sharp phase transition at the critical value c 3 ≈ 0.918 (which is the critical ratio for 3-XOR-SAT, see <ref type="bibr">Dubois &amp; Mandler, 2002</ref>). We will show that, for e ≥ 3, the introduction of universal variables in XOR-formulas does not influence the sharp transition.</p><p>Theorem 4.1 For every e ≥ 3 and any integer a, the (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property has a sharp threshold which coincides with the one of the e-XOR-SAT property. since E and C are chosen independently.

The same holds for the property e-Max-rank (since Pr n,L (e-Max-rank) = P (L) ). In particular, for e = 3, we have shown that (a,e)-QXOR-SAT as well as 3-Max-rank have a sharp threshold with a critical value c 3 ≈ 0.918, which is the critical ratio for 3-XOR-SAT <ref type="bibr">(Dubois &amp; Mandler, 2002</ref>).</p></div>

On the other hand, in contrast with QSAT, we have proved that the location of the phase transition-the critical ratio-is the same for the two properties XOR-SAT and QXOR-SAT, and that the difference of behavior between these two properties occurs at the level of the distribution function.</p></div>
