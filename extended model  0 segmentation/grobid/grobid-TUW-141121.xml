				<p>Multimedia content can be described in versatile ways as its essence is not limited to one view. For music data these multiple views could be a song&apos;s audio features as well as its lyrics. Both of these modalities have their advantages as text may be easier to search in and could cover more of the &apos;content semantics&apos; of a song, while omitting other types of semantic categorisation. (Psycho)acoustic feature sets, on the other hand, provide the means to identify tracks that &apos;sound simi-lar&apos; while less supporting other kinds of semantic categorisation. Those discerning characteristics of different feature sets meet users&apos; differing information needs. We will explain the nature of text and audio feature sets which describe the same audio tracks. Moreover, we will propose the use of textual data on top of low level audio features for music genre classification. Further, we will show the impact of different combinations of audio features and textual features based on content words.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The large-scale adoption of new business models for digital audio material is hap- pening already. What many content providers and online music vendors are still missing are appropriate means of presenting their media to their users according to different information needs. Amazon 1 or last.fm 2 have shown the potential of recommendation engines based on the mining of transactional data.</p><p>It further is an intrinsic need for every Music Information Retrieval system to include not only recommendation or playlist generation engines, but also pos- sibilities for searching and browsing. Music Information Retrieval has made huge progress in terms of devising sophisticated descriptors for the acoustic content of music. Research in this direction facilitates numerous content-based search scenarios, such as query by humming, or organisation tasks, such as genre classi- fication, playlist generation, and browsing access by perceived sound similarity.</p><p>Song lyrics cover semantic information about a song's contents on a level that could never be covered by audio features only. Many users may rather 1 http://www.amazon.combe interested in songs that cover similar topics than sound alike. Some musical genres, such as e.g. Christmas candles, can only be detected by including textual features, as they occur across many different musical genres and the definition of the genre itself is rather done on a topic level.</p><p>We thus combine both textual as well as audio information for music genre classification, i.e. automatically assigning musical genres to tracks based on audio features as well as content words in song lyrics.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of related work. This is followed by a description of our classification experiments in Section 3, as well as outlook on current work in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>The area of Music Information Retrieval has been heavily researched, particu- larly focusing on audio feature extraction. First experiments with content-based Music Information Retrieval were reported in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> as well as <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, the focus be- ing on automatic genre classification of music. In this paper we use a modified version of the Rhythm Patterns features, previously used within the SOMeJB system <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Based on that feature set, <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> shows that the Statistical Spectrum Descriptors yield relatively good results at a manageable dimensionality.</p><p>A sophisticated semantic and structural analysis including language identi- fication of songs based on lyrics is conducted in <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Artist similarity based on song lyrics is performed in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, pointing out that similarity retrieval using lyrics is inferior to acoustic similarity. It is also suggested that a combination of lyrics and acoustic similarity could improve results, further motivating the research reported in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments</head><p>Due to the lack of public benchmark corpora, we created a parallel corpus of audio and song lyrics files of a music collection of 9.758 titles organised into 41 genres. Class sizes ranged from only a few songs for the 'Classical' genre to about 1.900 songs for 'Punk Rock'. In order to utilise the information contained in music for genre classification, we describe sets of audio features derived from the waveform of audio tracks as well as the bag-of-word features for song lyrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Audio Features</head><p>Three features were computed from audio tracks in standard PCM format with 44.1 kHz sampling frequency (e.g. decoded MP3 files). Rythm Patterns (RP) <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, also called Fluctuation Patterns, denote a matrix representation of fluctuations on critical bands (parts of it describe rhythm in the narrow sense), resulting in a 1.440 dimensional feature space. Statistical Spectrum Descriptors (SSDs, 168 dimensions) are statistical moments derived from a psycho-acoustically trans- formed spectrogram <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Rhythm Histograms (RH, 60 dimensions) are calculated as the sums of the magnitudes of each modulation frequency bin of all 24 critical bands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Lyrics Features</head><p>For every piece of music, three lyrics portals were accessed, using artist name and track title as queries. If the results from lyrc.com.ar were of reasonable size, these lyrics were assigned to the track. If lyrc.com.ar fails, sing365lyrics.com will be checked for validity, then oldielyrics.com. All lyrics were processed using the bag-of-words model and weighted by tfidf information. Feature selection was done via document frequency thresholding, i.e. the omittance of terms that occur in a very high or very low number of documents. For the matrices used for the experiments terms occurring in more than half of the documents were omitted, the lower threshold was then adjusted to meet the desired dimensionality. Downscaling was performed to different di- mensionalities matching the dimensionalities of the audio feature spaces. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows classification accuracies for a set of experiments based on audio and lyrics features as well as combinations thereof. Experiments were performed by Weka's implementation of Support Vector Machines for ten-fold stratified cross validation. Results shown are the macro averaged classification accuracies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Classification Results</head><p>Results show that a combination of lyrics and audio features improves over- all classification performance. The best results were achieved by the 'LYRICS + RP' setting (C3), closely followed by the 'LYRICS + SSD' experiment (C2). The higher-dimensional the data for the lyrics experiments is, the higher is its classification accuracy, implying that there is even more discriminating informa- tion contained in lyrics (see experiments L1 -L4), which is not covered in this context because of the limitations of the simple concatenation approach. For combination experiments (C1 -C3) we use balanced combinations of features, i.e. the dimensionality of the lyrics component always equals the dimensionality of the audio feature component.</p><p>For statistical significance testing we used a paired T-test for a significance level of α = .05. Results showed that A2 performs better than A1 (p = .0143), but there is no significant difference between A2 and A3 (p = .9353). Further, it is shown that C3 performed better than both A2 (p = .1934) and L3 (p = .0129). However, the results are not significantly different from experiment L4 (p = .1755), leading to the conclusion that high-dimensional lyrics data only is a strong basis for a classifier. Hence a classifier based on differing numbers of lyrics than audio features, e.g. more dimensions in the lyrics than in the audio space, might further improve classification accuracy. Yet, by combining lyrics and audio (C2) the same performance was achieved at a fraction of the dimensionality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>We showed that the combination of multi-modal features for information re- trieval increases classification accuracy. Future work will deal with better means of combining classification results. Ensemble methods might prove useful, over- coming the limitation of implicit feature weighting encountered in the current setting. Additionally, stylistic features for text genre classification are currently being integrated. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>References 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Jonathan Foote.
