			<abstract>
				<p>The strategic management of intellectual capital involves rethinking how the companies creates value from a knowledge -centric perspective and redesigning and orchestrating the role of staff knowledge in the firm&apos;s strategy. This paper presents the author&apos;s software system for facilitating decision making at a strategic level in terms of the profitability of investment in staff knowledge. This software is a computer implementation of the method for planning and selection of personnel in SME. information systems that support knowledge management in SMEs can give guarantees a constant competitive advantage in the market.</p>

Many useful studies on the development of information sharing systems and col- laborative tools to support intra-organizational processes and teamwork also exist <ref type="bibr">(Chen and Liang, 1999</ref>). However, both the methodology and software system functionality for knowledge management are highly de- pendent on the process characteristics and the knowledge involved.</p><p>The competitive advantage of companies, especially SMEs, decide to increasingly knowledge and innovation potential. Knowledge is a broad concept, embracing both the knowledge formalized (explicit) and non-formal knowledge (hidden). Looking at the relationship between data, information, management information and knowledge <ref type="bibr">(Senn, 1990)</ref> should be regarded knowledge as a strategic resource company.

Streszczenie: Strategiczne zarządzanie kapitałem inte-
lektualnym w przedsiębiorstwach, w szczególności w 
sektorze MSP, wymaga właściwego postrzegania warto-
ści wiedzy oraz pracowników wiedzy. W artykule przed-

podejmowanie decyzji w zakresie planowania i doboru 
personelu w MSP. System ten stanowi implementację 
autorskiej metody planowania i doboru personelu w MSP.
