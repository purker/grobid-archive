				<p>The strategic management of intellectual capital involves rethinking how the companies creates value from a knowledge -centric perspective and redesigning and orchestrating the role of staff knowledge in the firm&apos;s strategy. This paper presents the author&apos;s software system for facilitating decision making at a strategic level in terms of the profitability of investment in staff knowledge. This software is a computer implementation of the method for planning and selection of personnel in SME. information systems that support knowledge management in SMEs can give guarantees a constant competitive advantage in the market.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The advantage of a company in the SME sector (small and medium sizes enterprises) is determined by effectiveness and the extent of the knowledge-workers' involvement. The role of intellectual capital management consists in striving to increase the share of immaterial resources (at the costs of the material ones) in the generated products, services, and the total market value of an organization (Król and Ludwiczyński, 2007).</p><p>The article presents the description of strategic knowledge resources in companies and author's method for plannig and selection of personnel in SME (see chapter 2). In the third chapter the author's software sys- tem for facilitating decision making at a strategic level in terms of the profitability of investment in staff knowledge is presented on example of the decision-making situation in which an innovative SME is considering the employ- ment of a new m-th employee. The summary shows the directions of further work. <ref type="figure">2. Author's method for planning and</ref> selection of strategic knowledge resources in SME To manage of intellectual capital more systematically, the firm must devise an agenda for transforming from an organisation simply comprising knowledge able individuals to a knowledge-focused organisation that stewards the creation and sharing of knowledge within and across internal business function and that orchestrates the flow of know-how to and from external firms.</p><p>While resources are important to the performance of a firm, according to a resource-based view, whether or not an organization gains a competitive advantage and any associated returns, depends on the strategic planning used to leverage those resources (Chrisman et al., 2003); <ref type="bibr">(McGrath and MacMillan, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The need to describe a strategic-knowledge resource was motivated by the concept of resource management (Sirmon and Hitt  <ref type="bibr">(Carayannis, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr">), (Drew, 1999</ref>. Many useful studies on the development of information sharing systems and col- laborative tools to support intra-organizational processes and teamwork also exist (Chen and Liang, 1999). However, both the methodology and software system functionality for knowledge management are highly de- pendent on the process characteristics and the knowledge involved.</p><p>The competitive advantage of companies, especially SMEs, decide to increasingly knowledge and innovation potential. Knowledge is a broad concept, embracing both the knowledge formalized (explicit) and non-formal knowledge (hidden). Looking at the relationship between data, information, management information and knowledge (Senn, 1990) should be regarded knowledge as a strategic resource company. als <ref type="bibr">[Hitt et al., 2001]</ref>.</p><p>Strategic <ref type="figure">Knowledge Resource in SMEs:</ref> unique resources of individual employees which allow SMEs to gain a sustainable competitive advantage The next chapter presents the author's software sys- tem for facilitating decision making at a strategic level in terms of the profitability of investment in staff knowledge, which considers all elements of the presented method.</p><p>Strategic Knowledge Resource: personnel SME usefulness function Wnm for the m-th employee in the SME: <ref type="figure">Wnm = f1(GK) +f2(PK) +f3(A) +f4(E) + f5(P) + f6(C) + f7(R),   3.

The application of the model makes it possible to obtain a forecast of the value of the strategic knowledge resources within a given or- ganisation. The decision-making situation, in which an innovative SME is considering the employment of the m-th employee, is presented in the diagram: <ref type="figure">Wnm = f1(GK) +f2(PK) +f3(A) +f4(E) + f5(P) + f6(C) + f7(R),  where: n, m∈ N,</ref> The two databases created on the basis of the replies of respondents in a The linear form of this function Wnm is chosen because all elements are independent and equally important to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of investment in knowledge. It is possible to receive indispensable data for account of value personnel usefulness function from com- panies belonged to reference model of SMEs <ref type="bibr">(PatalasMaliszewska, 2009</ref>) by interview in each enterprise. Each employee should complete the questionnaire. On the basis of an algorithm for testing solutions for each em- ployee it is possible to receive a specific value of the per- sonnel usefulness function and each of the parameters of this function. • Database of values of the personnel usefulness function: Wnm for each m-th employee in area Fn n,m∈N,</p></div>

Also the author has described the example of the company A2, which is looking for an em- ployee to the fill the position of 'regional assistant'. The company expects to retain its current level of innovation. <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> Example of using the author's software system Using the proposed system, it is possible to check to see whether the company complies with the specified refer- ence model. A potential new employee selects actions that will be performed in the company. The developed reference model will help companies to determine the work place for a new employee.</p><p>Through the use of the tool known as the system to sup- port decision making at the strategic level with regards to the assessment of knowledge in an innovative SME, which is the implementation of the method for planning and selection of personnel in SME, the following informa- tion was produced: • For m4 -Regional Assistant: <ref type="figure">*   =-0,6490+3,4592X7-2,2539X13- 2,0984X7  2 1,7486X13  2 +3,8323X7X13, where</ref> X7 -number of employees with scientific degrees, X13 -the number of purchased and used licenses. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref> Example of using the author's software system  <ref type="figure">*   =-0,6490+3,4592X7-2,2539X13-2,0984X7  2 -  1,7486X13  2 +3,8323X7X13, where</ref> X7 -number of employees with scientific degrees, X13 -the number of purchased and used licenses Using the the author's software system, the actual value of the personnel usefulness function for a new employee is checked (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 6):   Fig. 4</ref> Example of using the author's software system thodical and uniformity, fairness and impartiality, profes- sionalism. <ref type="figure">References   Fig. 6</ref> Example of using the author's software system Then we compare the actual value of the personnel use- fulness function with the expected new employee. If these values are similar, it is assumed that the employment of the employee will allow us to maintain the current level of innovation within the company.</p></div>
