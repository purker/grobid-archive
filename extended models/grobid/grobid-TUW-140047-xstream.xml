  <title>MIREX 2006 Computing Statistical Spectrum Descriptors for Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval Thomas Lidy Andreas Rauber Vienna University of Technology Department of Software Technology and Interactive Systems</title>
  <abstractText>This paper describes our submission to the MIREX 2006 Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval task. The task was to submit an audio feature extraction algorithm, to compute music similarity measures and to return a distance matrix from an audio collection consisting of 5000 pieces, which was subsequently evaluated through human listening tests as well as objective statistics. We submitted a new implementation of the Statistical Spectrum Descriptor (SSD) audio feature extractor and computed the distance matrix directly from feature space. Results from the human evaluation show that our approach is among the top 5 algorithms which furthermore show no statistically significant performance differences. The evaluation of a number of objective statistics ranked our algorithm 3rd in most of the cases. Our submission was one of the two fastest in terms of total run-time, having the shortest distance computation time. The approach has also been evaluated on Audio Cover Song Identification, where it was the best-performing &quot;Au-dio Music Similarity and Retrieval&quot; submission, outper-formed, however, by 4 submissions which were specifically designed for the cover identification task. 1. Introduction creation, music recommendation, or retrieval of &quot;similar&quot; pieces of music from an archive. Regardless of this open issue, MIREX is well established as the forum for annual exchange within the research community and evaluation of algorithm performance for a range of different tasks and approaches the MIR community is faced with, and that researchers are currently working on. Our department has a strong background on information retrieval with a focus on data visualization and clustering of data, e.g. on Self-Organizing Maps. As &quot;Department of Software Technology and Interactive Systems&quot; we are also developing applications for interaction with data, such as music and text archives [1]. Besides the traditional focus on unsupervised clustering of archives, we furthermore investigate machine learning approaches for classification of data collections, for tasks such as music genre classification [2]. In any of these areas efficient feature extraction from audio is required and therefore we are as well active in research on audio feature extractors. MIREX is a great opportunity for us to evaluate the audio features we employ in our applications and to compare them with state-of-the-art algorithms, both in terms of efficiency with regard to similarity as well</abstractText>
