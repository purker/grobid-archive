			<abstract>
				<p>Answer-set programming (ASP) is an emerging logic-programming paradigm that strictly separates the description of a problem from its solving methods. Despite its semantic elegance, ASP suffers from a lack of support for program developers. In particular, tools are needed that help engineers in detecting erroneous parts of their programs. Unlike in other areas of logic programming , applying tracing techniques for debugging logic programs under the answer-set semantics seems rather unnatural, since employing imperative solving algorithms would undermine the declarative flavour of ASP. In this paper, we present the system spock, a debugging support tool for answer-set programs making use of ASP itself. The implemented techniques maintain the declarative nature of ASP within the debugging process and are independent of the actual computation of answer sets. 1 General Information Answer-set programming (ASP) [1] has become an important logic-programming paradigm for declarative problem solving, incorporating fundamental concepts of non-monotonic reasoning. A major reason why ASP has not yet found a more widespread popularity as a problem-solving technique, however, is its lack of suitable engineering tools for developing programs. In particular, realising tools for debugging answer-set programs is a clearly recognised issue in the ASP community, and several approaches in this direction have been proposed in recent years [2-5]. From a theoretical point of view, the nonmonotonicity of answer-set programs is an aggravating factor for detecting sources of errors, since every rule of a program might significantly influence the resulting answer sets. On the other hand, applying tracing techniques for debugging logic programs under the answer-set semantics seems rather unnatural, since employing imperative solving algorithms would undermine the declarative flavour of ASP.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Answer-Set Programs</head><p>A (normal) logic program (over an alphabet A) is a finite set of rules of the form a ← b 1 , . . . , b m , not c 1 , . . . , not c n , <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> where a and b i , c j ∈ A are atoms, for 0 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ n. A literal is an atom a or its negation not a. For a rule r as in (1), let head (r) = a be the head of r and body(r) = {b 1 , . . . , b m , not c 1 , . . . , not c n } the body of r. Furthermore, we define body + (r) = {b 1 , . . . , b m } and body − (r) = {c 1 , . . . , c n }. For a logic program Π, a set X of atoms is an answer set of Π iff X is a minimal model of {head (r) ← body + (r) | r ∈ Π, body − (r)∩X = ∅}. For uniformity, we assume that any integrity constraint ← body (r) is expressed as a rule w ← body(r), not w, where w is a globally new atom. Moreover, we allow nested expressions of form not not a, where a is some atom, in the body of rules. Such rules are identified with normal rules in which not not a is replaced by not a ⋆ , where a ⋆ is a globally new atom, together with an additional rule a ⋆ ← not a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tagging-Based Debugging</head><p>In what follows, we sketch the theoretical principles underlying our system spock. For a more detailed discussion, we refer to Brain et al. <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The main idea of tagging is to split the head from the body, for each rule in a program, and thereby to intervene into the applicability of rules. After this division, tags are installed for triggering rules. This way, the formation of answer sets can be controlled, and tags in the answer sets of the transformed (or tagged) program reflect inherent properties of the original program. Technically, a program Π (over alphabet A) to debug is rewritten into a program T K <ref type="bibr">[Π]</ref> over an extended alphabet A + . Let Π be a logic program over A and consider a bijection n, assigning to each rule r over A a unique name n r . Then, the program T K <ref type="bibr">[Π]</ref> over A + consists of the following rules, for r ∈ Π, b ∈ body + (r), and c ∈ body − (r): head (r) ← ap(n r ), not ko(n r ), (2) ap(n r ) ← ok(n r <ref type="figure">), body(r),  (3</ref>) bl(n r ) ← ok(n r ), not b, (4) bl(n r ) ← ok(n r ), not not c, (5) ok(n r ) ← not ok(n r ). <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref> The tags ap(n r ) and bl(n r ) express whether a rule r is applicable or blocked, respec- tively, while the control tags ko(n r ), ok(n r ), and ok(n r ) are used for manipulating the application of r. Intuitively, the rules of Π are split into rules of forms (2) and (3), separating the applicability of a rule from the actual occurrence of the respective rule head in an interpretation. Analogously, rules of forms (4) and (5) elicit which rules are blocked. Tags stating whether rule r is applicable or blocked are only derived if ok(n r ) holds, which is by default the case, as expressed by rules of form (6). We call T K <ref type="bibr">[Π]</ref> the kernel tagging of Π, since it serves as a basic submodule for more enhanced programs facilitating certain debugging requests. One such extension scenario is the extrapolation of non-existing answer sets of a program Π over A. Using further translations, T P , T C , and T L <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, the occurrence of abnormality tags, ab p (n r ), ab c (a), and ab l (a), respectively, in an answer set X + of the transformed program provides information why an interpretation X = X + ∩ A is not an answer set of Π. Here, we make use of the Lin-Zhao theorem <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, which qualifies answer sets as models of the completion <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> and the loop formulas of a program. In particular, the program-oriented abnormality tag ab p (n r ) indicates that rule r is applicable but not satisfied with respect to an interpretation. The completion-oriented abnormality tag ab c (a) signals that a is in the considered interpretation but all rules having a as head are blocked. Finally, the presence of a loop-oriented abnormality tag ab l (a) indicates that the derivation of atom a might recursively depend on a itself and, therefore, violate the minimality criterion for answer sets. Note that all transformations used are polynomial in the size of the input program and can be constructed for all programs under consideration, even for programs without answer sets.</p></div>

Likewise, uhura is not sup- ported with respect to {bones, jim, uhura}. Finally, {chekov , jim, uhura} is not an answer set as it does not satisfy rule r 5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion and Related Work</head><p>In this paper, we presented spock, a prototype implementation of a debugging sup- port tool for answer-set programs. The implemented methodology relies on theoretical results of previous work <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> and is based on the idea that programs to be debugged are translated into other programs having answer sets that offer debugging-relevant in- formation about the original programs. After an initial kernel transformation, we get insight into the applicability of rules with respect to individual answer sets. In a further step, the system allows for identifying causes why interpretations are not answer sets. Here, spock distinguishes between abnormalities due to missing or spare atoms, or atoms whose presence in an interpretation is self-caused. In order to restrict the amount of information returned to the programmer, standard ASP optimisation techniques can be used to focus on interpretations with a minimal number of abnormalities. In addition to the tagging technique described here, spock also supports another approach towards debugging answer-set programs based on meta-programming <ref type="bibr">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">14]</ref>. Future work in- cludes the integration of further aspects of the translation approach and the design of a graphical user interface to ease the use of the features spock provides. Implementations of related techniques include smdebug <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>, a prototype debugger focusing on odd-cycle-free inconsistent programs. The system is designed to find mini- mal sets of constraints, restoring consistency when removed from a program. Brain and De Vos <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> present the system IDEAS, implementing two query algorithms addressing the questions why a set of literals is true with respect to some or false with respect to all answer sets of a program. Both algorithms are procedural and similar to the ones used in ASP solvers, suggesting that an approach using program-level transformations would be more practical. Pontelli and Son <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> developed a preliminary implementa- tion for their adoption of so-called justifications <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16]</ref> to the problem of debugging answer-set programs. Their system returns visual output in form of graphs explaining why atoms are (not) present in an answer set.   10. GNU General Public License -Version 2, June 1991.
