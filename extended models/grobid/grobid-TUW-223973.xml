			<abstract>
				<p>Translating clinical practice guidelines into a computer-inter-pretable format is a challenging and laborious task. In this project we focus on supporting the early steps of the modeling process by automatically identifying conditional activities in guideline documents in order to model them automatically in further consequence. Therefore, we developed a rule-based, heuristic method that combines domain-independent information extraction rules and semantic pattern rules. The classification also uses a weighting coefficient to verify the relevance of the sentence in the context of other information aspects, such as effects, intentions , etc. Our evaluation results show that even with a small set of training data, we achieved a recall of 75 % and a precision of 88 %. This outcome shows that this method supports the modeling task and eases the translation of CPGs into a semi-formal model. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are defined as &quot;systematically developed statements to assist practitioners and patient decisions about appropriate health-care for specific circumstances&quot; [6]. They include recommendations describing appropriate care for the management of patients with a specific clinical condition. An important part of CPG contents refers to the procedures to perform, often formulated together with specific conditions that have to hold in order to execute an activity. CPGs are published as textual guidelines, but in order to deploy them in some kind of computerized tool (e.g., a reminder system or a more complex decision-support system) they have to be represented in specialized languages (see [15, 7] for a comparison and overview). Although different authoring/editing tools are often associated with these languages, authoring is a labor-intensive task that requires comprehensive knowledge in medical as well as computer science. There have been several approaches to ease the modeling process, amongst others by introducing intermediate representations that provide more semi-struc-tured and less formal formats. One of them is MHB, the Many-Headed Bridge 2 [21], that tries to bridge the gap between the guideline text and its corresponding formalized model. It falls in the category of document-centric approaches [22] and is devised to produce a non-executable XML document with the relevant CPG fragments, starting from the original text. The knowledge of a CPG is thereby represented in a series of chunks that correspond to a certain bit of information in the CPG (e.g., a sentence, part of a sentence, more than one sentence). The information in a chunk is structured in various dimensions, e.g., control flow, data flow. To additionally support the modeling task for non-IT experts, MHB was further developed and split into MHB-F (free-text version) and MHB-S (semantically enriched version) [19]. MHB-F now provides a very simplified structure to make the modeling even for non-IT experts feasible and to leave modeling details to knowledge engineers in a later step. In order to ease the laborious modeling, parts of the task should be automated by applying information extraction methods. In this work we will focus on the identification of condition-action sentences that form a prominent aspect of the process flow in CPGs. The discovery of such combinations is not a trivial one. On the one hand, condition-action sentences are rarely of the form &apos;if condition then action&apos;, but require more sophisticated identification methods. On the other hand, conditions may refer to effects, intentions, or events and not activities, and these combinations have to be sorted out by our method. Table 1 shows a few example sentences in regard to their MHB-F aspects.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Work</head><p>Guideline developers edit CPGs in a free-text format. In order to transform the medical knowledge described in a guideline into execution models a translation process is required. Moser and Miksch <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> detected prototypical patterns in free- text guidelines to bridge this gap. Serban et al. <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> proposed an ontology-driven extraction of linguistic patterns to pre-process a CPG in order to retrieve control knowledge. The evaluation showed that the modeling as well as the authoring process of guidelines was supported. Language engineering methods were used in SeReMed <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> to detect diagnoses or procedures in medical documents. The method was successfully applied to X-ray reports. These documents however, show a standardized structure and therefore are easier to handle by knowledge engineering methods than CPGs. Taboada et al. <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref> identified relationships be- tween diagnoses and therapy entities in free-text documents by matching the core information units of a sentence with a collection of predefined relationships but the quality of this matching was not rated. To implement a rule based ap- proach to recognize medical entities the MeTAE (Medical Texts Annotation and Exploration) platform was used by Abacha and Zweigenbaum <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Additionally, semantic relations between each pair of these entities were identified by means of MetaMap <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Consequently, relations between a problem (e.g., disease) and a corresponding treatment were found. The method was applied to selected arti- cles and abstracts of PubMed but not to CPGs. In <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> a heuristic-based approach using information extraction methods independent of the final guideline repre- sentation language was defined. This method was implemented and applied to several guidelines containing a high amount of semi-structured text. The adop- tion of this methodology on 'living-guidelines' <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref> showed promising results. A set of semantic patterns representing activities based on semantic relations was generated by Kaiser et al. <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> to identify medical activities in CPGs. Its effec- tiveness was proved by a study which showed that a large part of control flow related aspects could be identified. The relation between the activity and a cor- responding condition, however, was not part of the method but is an important</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methods</head><p>Condition-based medical activities are expressed in clinical practice guidelines in various ways and mostly found in single sentences. These sentences affect the clinical pathway and therefore are relevant to the computer-interpretable model of the guideline. In order to classify such a sentence as relevant, we based our approach on the following hypothesis:</p><p>1. A sentence owns a certain domain independent linguistic structure, and 2. contains recurrent domain dependent semantic key patterns.</p><p>We propose a rule-based, heuristic method using linguistic and semantic pat- terns to classify sentences in CPGs as relevant for describing conditional activ- ities in order to move towards an automatic translation of such sentences into MHB in a following future step (an example is shown in Figure 1). Therefore, we analyzed a CPG document to develop a general linguistic pattern set and a semantic pattern set based on UMLS Semantic Types. These pattern sets then form the basis for the subsequent classification by calculating the relevance rate  <ref type="bibr">"&gt; ................... &lt;/control&gt;</ref> "If the patient does not fit the criteria for admission an assessment of fetal wellbeing including appropriate use of electronic fetal monitoring should be performed." </p></div>

We analyzed this chapter with regard to the control flow aspects and started generating an initial linguistic pattern set based on trigger words (12 occurrences for 'if' and 4 occurrences for 'should'). </p></div>

Therefore, we used the MetaMap plugin within the GATE framework to automatically identify medical concepts in our text and assign them to their corresponding UMLS concepts and semantic types (represented by four-letter abbreviations -e.g., 'popg' stands for 'Population Group'). By this way it was possible to find out the sequence of semantic types in the clauses of the sentences (see Fig. 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7</head><p>The relevance rate rr is a measure to find out whether a sentence contains a condition-action combination. Furthermore, it shall classify a sentence as crucial for the clinical pathway in contrast to other information aspects like intentions or explanations which are modeled in MHB-F in a different way. To find this se- mantic difference the syntax of the sentences as well as their containing medical semantic types must be respected. In order to calculate the relevance rate for a selected sentence its semantic abstraction has to be generated and compared with every entry in the semantic pattern pool. If the rule type and the semantic clause type are matching, the similarity of the sequences of the semantic types is calculated by using the Dice coefficient <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. The highest value is selected for further calculation.</p><p>In general, the value of the relevance rate rr is the sum of -the weight(w) of the applied general IE rule, and -the sum of the maximum similarity value (s i ) for each semantic clause of the sentence divided by the number of semantic clauses (n) identified by the general IE rules.</p><p>rr = w + n i=1 max{s i } n <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> The weight of the IE rule and the arithmetic average of the similarity values - both in the range between 0 and 1 -have the same influence on the rr. The similarity value s i of the semantic clause of a sentence and a matching entry in the semantic pattern pool were calculated as follows:</p><p>-If the semantic clause contains only one semantic type it is compared to those entries of the semantic pattern pool that also show only one semantic type (to receive a better accuracy). In the case that both types are equal the value for s i is set to 1.0, otherwise -both sequences of semantic types are interpreted as a string each and two sets of 4-letter string bigrams are composed out of them. Subsequently, these two sets are used for the calculation of the Dice coefficient.</p></div>

Twenty out of the 50 sentences had been modeled in MHB as control flow related aspects (activities based on special medical conditions) and therefore their rr was expected to be higher than 1. The other 30 sentences represented information about intentions and explanations in MHB with an expected rr lower or equal 1. The evaluation results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 5</ref> differentiated by the rule types. With the described method it was possible to identify 15 sentences which correctly contained control flow related aspects. Only two sentences got an in- correct rr higher than 1. They were not correctly rated, because they did not describe condition-based activities. Other 5 sentences got an rr lower than 1 although their rr should have been higher as they contained condition-based activities. Thus, the method had a recall of 75% and a precision of 88% (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 6</ref>). The negative predictive value of 79% was higher than the recall value and showed that 28 sentences had been correctly classified.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head><p>0.5 Sentences with such a linguistic structure did not exist in the Asthma guideline → no IE rule was implemented to identify semantic clauses The analyzed guidelines contained 7 sentences with control flow related in- formation but they were not classified because their patterns did not exist in the Asthma guideline. Consequently, no corresponding general linguistic IE rule ex- isted in the pattern pool. An extension of the general linguistic pattern set with rules for the trigger words "when", "could" and "in case of" should be taken into consideration. Additionally, 1 condition based activity could not be found, because the semantic information was distributed over more than one sentence. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 7</ref> selected examples are shown with a relevance rate lower or equal than 1.0 together with the corresponding reasons.</p><p>Even though only a small amount of training data (16 sentences) was avail- able from the Asthma guideline, our method identified condition-based activities for control flow related aspects in a guideline document. Furthermore, it showed that the combination of domain independent information extraction rules and an automatically created semantic pattern pool leads to valuable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Further Work</head><p>The aim of this paper was to develop a method to identify condition-action sen- tences. By defining a set of linguistic patterns we split up sentences semantically -from one selected training guideline -into their clauses showing the condition and the consequence. We used the UMLS Semantic Network <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> to find out which types of medical concepts were applied in these clauses. The outcome was a semantic abstraction of every training sentence which then was stored in a semantic pattern pool. This pool facilitated the classification of new sentences regarding to their relevance to the corresponding MHB-F model expressed by the measure relevance rate (rr).</p><p>Modeling experts benefit from the method in two ways:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1.</head><p>Condition-based activities in free-text guidelines, which must be modeled in MHB-F, are identified and rated. 2. These sentences are automatically split into the condition and the resulting activity.</p><p>An integration of the presented method into modeling tools will ease the work of all parties involved. Ongoing steps will be (1) the implementation of additional information ex- traction rules to expand the general linguistic pattern set in order to improve the hit rate; (2) the extension of the semantic pattern pool with additional training data in order to increase the significance of the relevance rate; (3) the applica- tion of the method in the context of 'living-guidelines' <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>; (4) an investigation,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>whether this method can support the modeling of processes also in other appli- cation areas by substituting the UMLS SN by other domain dependent thesauri; <ref type="bibr">(5</ref>) the refinement of information extraction rules to make a step towards an au- tomatic translation of condition-based activities of free-text guidelines into the modeling language MHB-F; and (6) the development of case studies to evidence the effectiveness of the method in real-world scenarios. If it is possible to tap the full potential of the presented method, the implementation of CPGs will be fostered tremendously.</p><p>Acknowledgement.
