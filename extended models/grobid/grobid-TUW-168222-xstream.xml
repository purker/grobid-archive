  <abstractText>Recent research results on communication science mention a relation between the inter-locutor&apos;s perceptional preferences, his or her mental representations and his or her choice of expressions. However, there is not any tool for analyzing such. In my research I combined lexical with computational linguistic methods to develop a software prototype that is able to analyze text on the usage of perceptional expressions. This analyzing tool can help to identify the interlocutor&apos;s perceptional preference for easier meeting his or her way of thinking and thereby facilitate the understanding. Still, for the German language, not much research</abstractText>
