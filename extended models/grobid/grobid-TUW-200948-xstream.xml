  <abstractText>We introduce a new approach for establishing fixed-parameter tractability of problems parameterized above tight lower bounds or below tight upper bounds. To illustrate the approach we consider two problems of this type of unknown complexity that were introduced by Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75, 2009). We show that a generalization of one of the problems and three nontrivial special cases of the other problem admit kernels of quadratic size. 1 Introduction A parameterized problem Π can be considered as a set of pairs (I, k) where I is the main part and k (usually an integer) is the parameter. Π is called fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if membership of (I, k) in Π can be decided in time O(f (k)|I| c), where |I| denotes the size of I, f (k) is a computable function, and c is a constant independent of k and I (for further background and terminology on parameterized complexity we refer the reader to the monographs [7, 8, 16]). If the nonparameterized version of Π (where k is just a part of the input) is NP-hard, then the function f (k) must be superpolynomial provided P = NP. Often f (k) is &quot;moderately exponential,&quot; which makes the problem practically feasible for small values of k. Thus, it is important to parameterize a problem in such a way that the instances with small values of k are of real interest. Consider the following well-known problem: given a digraph D = (V, A), find an acyclic subdigraph of D with the maximum number of arcs. We can parameterize this problem &quot;naturally&quot; by asking whether D contains an acyclic subdigraph with at least k arcs. It is easy to prove that this parameterized problem is fixed-parameter tractable by observing that D always has an acyclic subdigraph with at least |A|/2 arcs. Both subdigraphs are acyclic and at least one of them has at least |A|/2 arcs.) However, k ≤ |A|/2 for every small value of k and almost every practical value of |A| and, thus, our &quot;natural&quot; parameterization is of almost no practical or theoretical interest. Instead, one should consider the following parameterized problem: decide whether D = (V, A) contains an acyclic subdigraph with at least |A|/2 + k arcs. We choose |A|/2 + k because |A|/2 is a tight lower bound on the size of a largest acyclic subdigraph. Indeed, the size of a largest acyclic subdigraph of a symmetric digraph In a recent paper [15] Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar provided several examples of problems of this type and argued that a natural parameterization is one above a tight lower bound for maximization problems, and below a tight upper bound for minimization problems. Furthermore, they observed that only a few non-trivial results are known for problems parameterized above a tight lower bound [10, 11, 13, 14], and they listed several problems parameterized above a tight lower bound whose complexity is unknown. The difficulty in showing whether such a problem is fixed-parameter tractable can be illustrated by the fact that often we even do not know whether the problem is in XP, i.e., can be solved in time O(|I| g(k)) for a computable function g(k). For example, it is non-trivial to see that the above-mentioned digraph problem is in XP when parameterized above the |A|/2 bound.</abstractText>
