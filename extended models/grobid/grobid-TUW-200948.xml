				<p>We introduce a new approach for establishing fixed-parameter tractability of problems parameterized above tight lower bounds or below tight upper bounds. To illustrate the approach we consider two problems of this type of unknown complexity that were introduced by Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75, 2009). We show that a generalization of one of the problems and three nontrivial special cases of the other problem admit kernels of quadratic size. 1 Introduction A parameterized problem Π can be considered as a set of pairs (I, k) where I is the main part and k (usually an integer) is the parameter. Π is called fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) if membership of (I, k) in Π can be decided in time O(f (k)|I| c), where |I| denotes the size of I, f (k) is a computable function, and c is a constant independent of k and I (for further background and terminology on parameterized complexity we refer the reader to the monographs [7, 8, 16]). If the nonparameterized version of Π (where k is just a part of the input) is NP-hard, then the function f (k) must be superpolynomial provided P = NP. Often f (k) is &quot;moderately exponential,&quot; which makes the problem practically feasible for small values of k. Thus, it is important to parameterize a problem in such a way that the instances with small values of k are of real interest. Consider the following well-known problem: given a digraph D = (V, A), find an acyclic subdigraph of D with the maximum number of arcs. We can parameterize this problem &quot;naturally&quot; by asking whether D contains an acyclic subdigraph with at least k arcs. It is easy to prove that this parameterized problem is fixed-parameter tractable by observing that D always has an acyclic subdigraph with at least |A|/2 arcs. Both subdigraphs are acyclic and at least one of them has at least |A|/2 arcs.) However, k ≤ |A|/2 for every small value of k and almost every practical value of |A| and, thus, our &quot;natural&quot; parameterization is of almost no practical or theoretical interest. Instead, one should consider the following parameterized problem: decide whether D = (V, A) contains an acyclic subdigraph with at least |A|/2 + k arcs. We choose |A|/2 + k because |A|/2 is a tight lower bound on the size of a largest acyclic subdigraph. Indeed, the size of a largest acyclic subdigraph of a symmetric digraph In a recent paper [15] Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar provided several examples of problems of this type and argued that a natural parameterization is one above a tight lower bound for maximization problems, and below a tight upper bound for minimization problems. Furthermore, they observed that only a few non-trivial results are known for problems parameterized above a tight lower bound [10, 11, 13, 14], and they listed several problems parameterized above a tight lower bound whose complexity is unknown. The difficulty in showing whether such a problem is fixed-parameter tractable can be illustrated by the fact that often we even do not know whether the problem is in XP, i.e., can be solved in time O(|I| g(k)) for a computable function g(k). For example, it is non-trivial to see that the above-mentioned digraph problem is in XP when parameterized above the |A|/2 bound.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Probabilistic Inequalities</head><p>In our approach we introduce a random variable X such that the answer to the problem parameterized above a tight lower bound or below a tight upper bound is yes if and only if X takes with positive probability a value greater or equal to the parameter k.</p><p>In this paper all random variables are real. A random variable is discrete if its distribution function has a finite or countable number of positive increases. A random variable X is a symmetric if −X has the same distribution function as X. If X is discrete, then X is symmetric if and only if Prob(X = a) = Prob(X = −a) for each real a. Let X be a symmetric variable for which the first moment E(X) exists. Then E(X) = E(−X) = −E(X) and, thus, E(X) = 0. The following is easy to prove <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. See Sections 3 and 4 for applications of Lemma 1. Unfortunately, often X is not symmetric, but Lemma 2 provides an inequality that can be used in many such cases. This lemma was proved by Alon et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>; a weaker version was obtained by Håstad and Venkatesh <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 2.

Then Prob( X &gt; σ 4 √ b ) ≥ 1 4 4/3 b</note><p>Since it is often rather nontrivial to evaluate E(X 4 ) in order to check whether E(X 4 ) ≤ bσ 4 holds, one can sometimes use the following result by Bourgain <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 3. Let f = f (x 1 , . . . , x n ) be a polynomial of degree r in n variables x 1 , . . . , x n with domain {−1, 1}. Define a random variable X by choosing a vec- tor ( 1 , . . . , n ) ∈ {−1, 1} n uniformly at random and setting X = f ( 1 , . . . , n ). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Linear Ordering</head><p>Let D = (V, A) be a digraph with no loops or parallel arcs in which every arc ij has a positive weight w ij . The problem of finding an acyclic subdigraph of D of maximum weight, known as Linear Ordering, has applications in economics <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Let n = |V | and consider a bijection α : V → {1, . . . , n}. Observe that the subdigraphs (V, { ij ∈ A : α(i) &lt; α(j) }) and (V, { ij ∈ A : α(i) &gt; α(j) }) are acyclic. Since the two subdigraphs contain all arcs of D, at least one of them has weight at least W/2, where W = ij∈A w ij , the weight of D. Thus, W/2 is a lower bound on the maximum weight of an acyclic subdigraph of D. Consider a digraph D where for every arc ij of D there is also an arc ji of the same weight. Each maximum weight subdigraph of D has weight exactly W/2. Hence the lower bound W/2 is tight.</p><p>Linear Ordering Above Tight Lower Bound (LOALB) Instance: A digraph D = (V, A), each arc ij has an integral positive weight w ij , and a positive integer k. Parameter: The integer k. Question: Is there an acyclic subdigraph of D of weight at least W/2+k, where W = ij∈A w ij ? Mahajan, Raman, and Sikdar <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> asked whether LOALB is fixed-parameter tractable for the special case when all arcs are of weight 1 (i.e., D is unweighted). In this section we will prove that LOALB admits a kernel with O(k 2 ) arcs; consequently the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. Note that if we allow weights to be positive reals, then we can show, similarly to the NP-completeness proof given in the next section, that LOALB is NP-complete already for k = 1.</p><p>Consider the following reduction rule:</p><p>Reduction Rule 1 Assume D has a directed 2-cycle iji; if w ij = w ji delete the cycle, if w ij &gt; w ji delete the arc ji and replace w ij by w ij − w ji , and if w ji &gt; w ij delete the arc ij and replace w ji by w ji − w ij .</p><p>It is easy to check that the answer to LOALB for a digraph D is yes if and only if the answer to LOALB is yes for a digraph obtained from D using the reduction rule as long as possible.

The problem LOALB admits a kernel with O(k 2 ) arcs.</p><p>Proof. Let H be a digraph. We know that the answer to LOALB for H is yes if and only if the answer to LOALB is yes for a digraph D obtained from H using Reduction Rule 1 as long as possible. Observe that D is an oriented graph. Let B be the set of bijections from V to {1, . . . , n}. Observe that f : B → B such that f (α(v)) = |V | + 1 − α(v) for each α ∈ B is a bijection. Note that X(f (α)) = −X(α) for each α ∈ B. Therefore, Prob(X = a) = Prob(X = −a) for each real a and, thus, X is symmetric. Thus, by is a bijection α : V → {1, . . . , n} such that X(α) ≥ k and, thus, the answer to LOALB (for both D and H) is yes. Otherwise, |A| ≤ W (2) &lt; 12 · k 2 . We close this section by outlining how Theorem 1 can be used to actually find a solution to LOALB if one exists. Let (D, k) be an instance of LOALB where D = (V, A) is a directed graph with integral positive arc-weights and k ≥ 1 is an integer. Let W be the total weight of D. As discussed above, we may assume that D is an oriented graph. If |A| &lt; 12k 2 then we can find a solution, if one exists, by trying all subsets A ⊆ A, and testing whether (V, A ) is acyclic and has weight at least W/2 + k; this search can be carried out in time 2</p><p>O(k 2 ) . Next</p><p>we assume |A| ≥ 12k 2 . We know by Theorem 1 that (D, k) is a yes-instance; it remains to find a solution.</p><p>For a vertex i ∈ V let d D (i) denote its unweighted degree in D, i.e., the number of arcs (incoming or outgoing) that are incident with i. Consider the following reduction rule:</p><p>Reduction Rule 2 If there is a vertex i ∈ V with |A| − 12k 2 ≥ d D (i), then delete i from D.</p><p>Observe that by applying the rule we obtain again a yes-instance (D − i, k) of LOALB since D − i has still at least 12k 2 arcs. Moreover, if we know a solution D i of (D − i, k), then we can efficiently obtain a solution D of (D, k):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>if</head><p>j∈N + (i) w ij ≥ j∈N − (i) w ij then we add i and all outgoing arcs ij ∈ A to D i ; otherwise, we add i and all incoming arcs ji ∈ A to D i . After multiple applications of Rule 2 we are left with an instance (D 0 , k) to which Rule 2 cannot be applied. Let D 0 = (V 0 , A 0 ). We pick a vertex i ∈ V 0 . If i has a neighbor j with d D0 (j) = 1, then |A 0 | ≤ 12k 2 , since |A 0 | − d D0 (j) &lt; 12k 2 . On the other hand, if d D0 (j) ≥ 2 for all neighbors j of i, then i has less than 2·12k 2 neighbors, since D 0 − i has less than 12k 2 arcs; thus |A 0 | &lt; 3 · 12k 2 . Therefore, as above, time 2</p><p>O(k 2 ) is sufficient to try all subsets A 0 ⊆ A 0 to find a solution to the instance (D 0 , k). Let n denote the input size of instance (D, k). Rule 2 can certainly be applied in polynomial time n O(1) , and we apply it less than n times. Hence, we can find a solution to (D, k), if one exists, in time n O Recall that a kernelization reduces in polynomial time an instance (I, k) of a parameterized problem to a decision-equivalent instance (I , k ), its problem kernel, where k ≤ k and the size of I is bounded by a function of k. Solutions for (I, k) and solutions for (I , k ) are possibly unrelated to each other. We call (I , k ) a faithful problem kernel if from a solution for (I , k ) we can construct a solution for (I, k) in time polynomial in |I| and k. Clearly the above (D 0 , k) is a faithful kernel.</p></div>

The problem Max Lin-2 asks for an assignment of values to the variables that maximizes the total weight of the satisfied equations. Let W = w 1 + · · · + w m .</p><p>To see that the total weight of the equations that can be satisfied is at least W/2, we describe a simple procedure suggested in <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. We assign values to the variables z 1 , . . . , z n one by one and simplify the system after each assignment. When we wish to assign 0 or 1 to z i , we consider all equations reduced to the form z i = b, for a constant b. Let W be the total weight of all such equations. We set z i := 0, if the total weight of such equations is at least W /2, and set z i := 1, otherwise. If there are no equations of the form z i = b, we set z i := 0. To see that the lower bound W/2 is tight, consider a system consisting of pairs of equations of the form i∈I z i = 1 and i∈I z i = 0 where both equations have the same weight.</p><p>The parameterized complexity of Max Lin-2 parameterized above the tight lower bound W/2 was stated by Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> as an open question:</p><p>Max Lin-2 Parameterized Above Tight Lower Bound (LinALB) Instance: A system S of m linear equations e 1 , . . . , e m in n variables z 1 , . . . , z n over GF(2), each equation e i with a positive integral weight w i , i = 1, 2, . . . , m, and a positive integer k. Each equation e j can be written as i∈Ij z i = b j , where ∅ = I j ⊆ {1, . . . , n}. Parameter: The integer k. Question: Is there an assignment of values to the variables z 1 , . . . , z n such that the total weight of the satisfied equations is at least W/2 + k, where W = m i=1 w i ? Let r j be the number of variables in equation e j , and let r(S) = max m i=1 r j . We are not able to determine whether LinALB is fixed-parameter tractable or not, but we can prove that the following three special cases are fixed-parameter tractable: <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> there is a set U of variables such that each equation contains an odd number of variables from U , (2) there is a constant r such that r(S) ≤ r, <ref type="bibr">(3</ref>) there is a constant ρ such that any variable appears in at most ρ equations.</p><p>Notice that in our formulation of LinALB it is required that each equation has a positive integral weight. In a relaxed setting in which an equation may have any positive real number as its weight, the problem is NP-complete even for k = 1 and each r j = 2. Indeed, let each linear equation be of the form z u + z v = 1. Then the problem is equivalent to MaxCut, the problem of finding a cut of total weight at least L in an undirected graph G, where V (G) is the set of variables, E(G) contains (z u , z v ) if and only if there is a linear equation z u + z v = 1, and the weight of an edge (z u , z v ) equals the weight of the corresponding linear equation. The problem MaxCut is a well-known NP- complete problem. Let us transform an instance I of MaxCut into an instance I of the "relaxed" LinALB by replacing the weight w i by w i := w i /(L − W/2). We may assume that L − W/2 &gt; 0 since otherwise the instance is immediately seen as a yes-instance. Observe that the new instance I has an assignment of values with total weight at least W /2 + 1 if and only if I has a cut with total weight at least L. We are done.</p><p>Let A be the matrix of the coefficients of the variables in S. It is well-known that the maximum number of linearly independent columns of A equals rankA, and such a collection of columns can be found in time polynomial in n and m, using, e.g., the Gaussian elimination on columns <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. We have the following reduction rule and supporting lemma.</p><p>Reduction Rule 3 Let A be the matrix of the coefficients of the variables in S, let t = rankA and let columns a i1 , . . . , a it of A be linearly independent. Then delete all variables not in {z i1 , . . . , z it } from the equations of S.</p><p>Lemma 5. Let T be obtained from S by Rule 3. Then T is a yes-instance if and only if S is a yes-instance. Moreover, T can be obtained from S in time polynomial in n and m.</p><p>Proof. If t = n, set T := S, so assume that t &lt; n. The remark before the lemma immediately implies that T can be obtained from S in time polynomial in n and m. Let S be a system of equations from S and let T be the corresponding system of equations from T . It is sufficient to prove the following claim:</p><p>There is an assignment of values to z 1 , . . . , z n satisfying all equations in S and falsifying the rest of equations in S if and only if there is an assignment of values to z i1 , . . . , z it satisfying all equations in T and falsifying the rest of equations in T .</p><p>Let an assignment z 0 of values to z = (z 1 , . . . , z n ) satisfy all equations of S and falsify the equations of S , where S = S \ S . This assignment satisfies all equations of R, the system obtained from S by replacing the right hand side b j of each equation in S by 1 − b j . Note that R has the same matrix A of coefficients with columns a 1 , . . . , a n . Let a column a i ∈ {a i1 , . . . , a it }. Then, by definition of a i1 , . . . , a it , a i = λ 1 a i1 + · · · + λ t a it for some numbers λ j ∈ {0, 1}. Knowing the numbers λ j , we may eliminate a variable z i from R by replacing a</p></div>

Thus, we may eliminate from R all variables z i ∈ {z i1 , . . . , z it } and get y i1 a i1 + · · · + y it a it = b , where b is the right hand side of R and each y j ∈ {0, 1}. Now replace, in the modified R, the right hand side b j of each equation corresponding to an equation in S by 1 − b obtaining T . Clearly, (y i1 , . . . , y it ) satisfies all equations of T and falsifies all equations in T = T \ T . Suppose now that (y i1 , . . . , y it ) satisfies all equations of T and falsifies all equations in T . Then (y 1 , . . . , y n ), where y j = 0 if j ∈ {i 1 , . . . , i t }, satisfies all equations of S and falsifies all equations in S .

Note that if the product X p X q X s X t contains a variable i in only one or three of the factors, then E(X p X q X s X t ) = A · E( i ) = 0, where A is a polynomial in random variables l , l ∈ {1, . . . , n} \ {i}. Thus, the only nonzero terms in (2) are those for which either (1) p = q = s = t, or (2) there are two distinct integers j, l such that each of them coincides with two elements in the sequence p, q, s, t, or (3) |{p, q, s, t}| = 4, but each variable i appears in an even number of the factors in X p X q X s X t . In Cases 1 and 2, we have E(X p X q X s X t ) = w</p></div>

Now assume, without loss of generality, that j = p and l = q. Since S is reduced under Rule 4, the product X j X l must have a variable i of degree one. Thus, i must be in X s or X t , but not in both (two choices). Assume that i is in X s . Observe that there are at most ρ − 1 choices for s. Note that X j X l X s must contain contain a variable i of odd degree. Thus, i must be in X t and, hence, there are at most ρ − 1 choices for t.  <ref type="figure">.    Case 1</ref> of Theorem 2 is of interest since its condition can be checked in polynomial time due to the following: Proposition 1. We can check, in polynomial time, whether there exists a set U of variables such that each equation of S contains an odd number of variables from U .</p><p>Proof. Observe that such a set U exists if and only if the unweighted system S of linear equations over GF(2) obtained from S by replacing each b j with 1 has a solution. Indeed, if U exists, set z j = 1 for each z j ∈ U and z j = 0 for each z j ∈ U . This assignment is a solution to S . If a solution to S exists, form U by including in it all variables z j which equal 1 in the solution. We can check whether S has a solution using the Gaussian elimination or other polynomial- time algorithms, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Now we can prove the following:</p><p>Theorem 2. Let S be reduced under Rule 4. The following three special cases of LinALB are fixed-parameter tractable: (1) there is a set U of variables such that each equation contains an odd number of variables from U , (2) there is a constant r such that r(S) ≤ r, (3) there is a constant ρ, such that any variable appears in at most ρ equations. In each case, there exists a kernel with O(k 2 ) equations and variables.</p><p>Proof. Case 1. Let z 0 = (z</p></div>

Thus, X is a symmetric random variable. Therefore, by Case 3. If ρ = 1, it is easy to find an assignment to the variables that satisfies all equations of S. Thus, we may assume that ρ ≥ 2. To prove that there exists a kernel with O(k 2 ) equations, we can proceed as in Case 2, but use Lemma 7 rather than Lemma 3. Remark 1. Note that even if S does not satisfy Case 2 of the theorem, T , the system obtained from S using Rule 3, may still satisfy Case 2. However, we have not formulated the theorem for S reduced under Rule 3 as the reduced system depends on the choice of a maximum linear independent collection of columns of A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussions</head><p>We have showed that the new method allows us to prove that some maximization problems parameterized above tight lower bounds are fixed-parameter tractable. Our method can also be used for minimization problems parameterized below tight upper bounds. As a simple example, consider the feedback arc problem: given a digraph D = (V, A) find a minimum set F of arcs such that D − F is acyclic. Certainly, |A|/2 is a tight upper bound on a minimum feedback set and we can consider the parameterized problem which asks whether D has a feedback arc set with at most |A|/2−k arcs. Fixed-parameter tractability of this parameterized problem follows immediately from fixed-parameter tractability of LOALB, but we could prove this result directly using essentially the same approach as for LOALB.  <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> allows one to obtain a smaller kernel for LOALB on dense digraphs than given in our paper. The proof of Theorem 2.1 in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> also uses a probabilistic approach, but it is more specialized than SABEM.</p><p>It would be interesting to obtain applications of our method to other problems parameterized above tight lower bounds or below tight upper bounds. One such very recent application is given in <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, where an open problem due to Benny Chor and described in <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> was solved.</p><p>Acknowledgments.
