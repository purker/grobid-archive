  <abstractText>Austria &apos; s school system is in a flux, educational standards and competence orientation are the two key topics. The declared objectives in this process are a sustainable increase of quality and a better comparability of educational attainment. This change is already partly implemented: in 2011, the Federal Ministry of Education , Arts and Culture (bm:ukk) released new educational standards for the vocational school system [1] which are orientated towards the development of well-defined competences. To this end, the ministry compiled competence models, descriptors and didactic examples for Informatics in technical high schools (HTL) as part of the project &quot;educational standards in vocational schools&quot;. These new curricula induce a twofold change: new contents and an orientation towards competence attainment. While the adaptation of the contents is caused by the dynamics of IT, the change towards competences bears challenges on multiple levels. The predominant method in the class rooms is still ex-cathedra teaching where the students assume a rather passive role. This is in conflict with the characteristics of competence orientation which calls for a paradigm shift in teaching. Therefore, new didactic concepts have to be developed that cater to the new contents and the demands of competence orientated teaching. This paper deals with the development and implementation of a didactic concept for the competence field &quot;Industrial Information Technology&quot; (INIT) within the vocational schools for information technology (HTL for IT) as a case study. The pursuit of this new concept entails the following central questions: Q1: In which way should teaching be designed as to ensure the educational standards for the competence field INIT? Q2: In which way can be ensured that individual learning goals are attained in combination with personal and social competencies? Q3: To what extent does a specific school influence the implementation of the new curricula with respect to activity-oriented teaching methods? Q4: In which way should teaching be designed as to foster creativity and intrinsic</abstractText>
