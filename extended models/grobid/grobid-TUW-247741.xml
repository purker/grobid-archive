				<p>Evaluating the quality of segmentations is an important process in image processing, especially in the medical domain. Many evaluation metrics have been used in evaluating segmentation. There exists no formal way to choose the most suitable metric(s) for a particular segmentation task and/or particular data. In this paper we propose a formal method for choosing the most suitable metrics for evaluating the quality of segmenta-tions with respect to ground truth segmentations. The proposed method depends on measuring the bias of metrics towards/against the properties of the the seg-mentations being evaluated. We firstly demonstrate how metrics can have bias towards/against particular properties and then we propose a general method for ranking metrics according to their overall bias. We finally demonstrate for 3D medical image segmentations that ranking produced using metrics with low overall bias strongly correlate with manual rankings done by an expert. Index Terms-image segmentation; evaluation met-rics; selection 1 Introduction 1.1 The need to understand metrics: Many evaluation metrics for image segmentation have been introduced; most researchers choose the evaluation metrics arbitrarily or according to their popularity. Investigating met-rics would help researchers to better understand them and help companies and stakeholders to save effort and time reaching optimal systems [1]. A poorly defined metric may lead to inaccurate conclusions like selecting suboptimal models when comparing the performance of classifiers [2]. Many researchers have investigated the drawbacks of particular metrics given particular properties of the data being classified. As a special case of classification, image segmentation is also affected by these drawbacks. The following are some examples: Hausdorff distance is very sensitive to noise and least squares based evaluation methods are very sensitive to out-liers [3]. Mutual information doesn&apos;t utilize spatial information inherited in images because only voxel relationships are considered but not the neighborhoods [4]. Information theoretical measures have a non-convergent baseline which depends on the ratio between the number of data points and the number of classes. Therefore this class of measure needs chance correction [5]. Commonly used measures (precision, recall and F-measures) are biased and don&apos;t consider the level of chance [6]. Choosing evaluation metrics is very important and application-dependent; when evaluating imbalanced datasets, the metric choice is not obvious [2]. Metrics have different properties with respect to their correlation with user satisfaction criteria and their ease of interpretation [7]. Benhabiles et al. [8] validated 250 automatic segmentations against their corresponding ground truth segmentations using four different evaluation metrics. The results were then compared with manual ratings from 40 human observers. They found that the correlations between the ranking based on the manual ratings and the rankings based on the evaluation metrics vary between 30% and 80% depending on the used metric. Research in the last decades generally results in the relative system improvement achieved becoming smaller and smaller. As a result, sensitivity and fidelity of evaluation metrics become increasingly critical. When improvements are small, metrics with high sensitivity are needed to measure small but real improvements and also with high fidelity to distinguish</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Problem</head><p>definition and notations: In this paper, we propose a formal method for selecting the most suit- able metrics to evaluate image segmentation depend- ing on the data being segmented and the goal of the segmentation task. The method is primarily based on two facts: the first is that effectiveness metrics can be biased towards or against properties of the images be- ing segmented, meaning that particular metrics over-penalize or over-reward segmentations given particu- lar properties <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The second fact is that selecting the best evaluation metrics can be sub- ject to the segmentation goal which means that the bias towards/against a particular property of the data can be differently important depending on the segmenta- tion goal <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. To meet the context dependency, the proposed method allows individual weighting of the influence of each property according to its importance in case this is known, which increases the effectiveness of the method.</p><p>The problem to be solved in this paper can be formulated as follows: given a set of metrics M = {M 1 , M2, ..., M r }, a set of image segmentations C = {C 1 , C 2 , ...., C k }, then the task is to rank the metrics in M according to their suitability for evaluating the qual- ity of the segmentations in C provided that for each segmentation there exists a ground truth segmentation.</p><p>The proposed method is general and can be applied to select evaluation metrics for all types of segmenta- tions. However, for simplicity, we will consider only the crisp segmentation task in this paper to present and for- mulate the method. In particular, we will be analyzing and testing the method using a special type of segmen- tation, namely medical volume segmentation e.g. mag- netic resonance images (MRI) where voxels (3D pixels) are either assigned or not to a given class (segment) e.g. an organ or a tumor.</p><p>paring seven evaluation metrics. They negate the belief that commonly used evaluation measures are equally reliable. Fatourechi et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> proposed a framework based on Desired Region of Operation (DROP) for se- lecting the best evaluation metric for evaluating imbal- anced classifications. Sakai <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> provided comparisons between metrics depending on the sensitivity and sta- bility using the Voorhees/Buckley swap method <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>. All these papers lack generality because they are meth- ods designed either for specific metrics or for specific metric properties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Jin et al. <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> established a formal method for compar- ing two different measures and introduced two criteria for formal comparison of the goodness of evaluation metrics, namely the degree of consistency (DoC) and degree of discriminancy (DoD). Applying these criteria, they showed theoretically and empirically that AUC is a better measure than accuracy in evaluating the perfor- mance of classifiers. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> applied formal constraints based on axiometry to compare and judge evaluation metrics depending on the grade of satisfaction of these constraints. Busin et al. <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> used axiometrics to define a formal and general notation that fits any effectiveness metric. Based on this notation, they proposed several axioms that should be satisfied by an effectiveness met- ric. They used these axioms as criteria to evaluate met- rics. All these papers deal with the problem only from a theoretical axiometrical point of view without taking into account the classification goal and the nature and properties of data being classified.</p><p>Sakai <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> proposed a method for evaluating evalu- ation metrics by measuring their sensitivity using Boot- strap Hypothesis Tests, and used this method in com-</p><p>We propose a method for choosing the most suitable metric for evaluating image segmentation. In Sec- tions 3.1 to 3.3, the method is described and discussed formally. Then this formal description is explained in a step by step demonstration with a real example in Sec- tion 4, which also provides an experimental evaluation of the method. Given a set of effectiveness metrics M and a set of segmentations C, each of the segmentations is evalu- ated against its ground truth segmentation using all metrics to obtain a ranking per metric. Now, choos- ing the most suitable metric goes in two main steps: (i) Constructing different partitions on the segmenta- tion set C and ranking the subsets of each partition ac- cording to their average quality regarding each metric. (ii) Inferring the metric bias from the rank correlations across all partitions and all metrics. In the following, each of the steps is described in more details. <ref type="figure">partitions and rank structure:   1</ref>. For each metric m ∈ M, evaluate each of the segmen- tations x ∈ C against its ground truth segmentation to get the score matrix s where s(x, m) is the score of segmentation x measured by metric m.</p></div>

For each metric m ∈ M, assign each segmentation x ∈ C a rank depending on its score to get the rank matrix r where r(x, m) is the rank of segmentation x measured by metric m.</p><p>3. Define a set F of t segmentation properties. These can be any features thought to impact metrics e.g. class imbalance, number of segments, segment size, noise, deviation, shape signatures, sphereness, boundary smoothness, resolution, moments, etc. Furthermore, features can also be score-dependent e.g. precision and recall for utilizing trade-off i.e. for evaluation that tends to reward precision on cost of recall and vice versa. If no features are known to impact metrics, simply use all available features.</p><p>4. Construct t different partitions on the segmentation set C, each partition according to one feature from F, i.e. according to the grade of occurrence of the feature in the segmentations. One gets the set of par- titions P = {P 1 , .., P t }. Each partition should have the same number of subsets s. The function P ij (x) assigns the segmentation x to the subset j according to partition i. given a particular partition R (we will call this correla- tion the biased correlation K).  <ref type="figure">r[R(p, ., m t ), R(p, ., m)] (5)</ref> P ij (x) = 1 x ∈ subset j of partition i 0 otherwise <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> 5. Construct t random partitionš P = { ˇ P 1 , .., ˇ P t } by ran- domly assigning segmentations to s equal subsets in each partition. The functioň P ij (x) that assigns a seg- mentation x to the subset j of the random partition i is defined by where m t is the metric being evaluated, p is a given partition, and r(x1, x2) is the Pearson's correlation co- efficient between the rankings x1 and x2 (the point de- notes all possible values, e.g. R(p, ., m) means all pos- sible subset ranks in partition p measured by metric m)</p><p>Now, we define the overall bias of metric m t to be the average of the absolute correlation change B </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>i∈P</head><p>6. For each metric m ∈ M, for each partition i ∈ P, rank the subsets j according to the average of the individ- ual ranks in each subset using the rank function Finally, the metrics in M are ranked according to their overall bias, where the metric with the lowest bias is the most suitable.</p><p>s mi (j) = ( ∑ <ref type="figure">P ij (x)=1   r(m, x)</ref>)/n ij <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref> where x ∈ C are the individual segmentations and n ij is the number of segmentations in the subset j of Partition i. Now, use the rank averages from Equa- tion 3 to compute the rank structure R = R(i, j, m) that gives the rank of subset j of partition i mea- sured by metric m according to descending rank av- erage. Analogously, ˇ R = ˇ R(i, j, m) gives the rank of subset j of the random partition i measured by met- ric m. Note that ranking the subsets using the aver- ages of the individual ranks in each subset is a rank- ing method inspired by the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>. This is because straightforwardly computing the ranks from score averages is sensitive to outliers and may produce unreasonable rankings if the scores are not normally distributed <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion:</head><p>To understand the key idea, let's think about the following two cases: Case 1, partition- ing the segmentations randomly. Case 2, partitioning the segmentations according to a particular property (e.g. class imbalance in the underlying segmentations). Given a particular metric m, the base correlatioň K(m) given by Equation 4 (related to Case 1) depends on the nature of the metric and is not affected by the proper- ties of the segmentations, since the partition is random. Now, if this correlation changes when we consider Case 2 (i.e. biased correlation K given by Equation 5), then the change is caused by the impact of the property used for partitioning (in this case class imbalance) on the metric and therefore it characterizes the bias of the metric towards/against this property. If many parti- tions (many properties) are used, then the sum of the correlation differences is a measure of the overall bias for the given metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Inferring</head><p>metric bias: Now, the rank structureš R (rankings of the random partitions) and R (rankings of the non-random partitions) provide a statistical ba- sis to infer metric bias by analyzing how rankings of the different metrics and different partitions are corre- lated. The analysis is primarily based on comparing two correlations: the average of the rank correlations given the random partitionš R (we will call this corre- lation the base correlatioň K) and the rank correlation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In this section, the proposed method is demonstrated and tested with a real example, namely a set of 229 au- tomatic brain tumor segmentations (MRI 3D volumes) from the BRATS2012 challenge 1 . were applied to the resulting rank structure. The result of this step is a metric list ranked according to bias.</p><p>To validate the suitability ranking produced by the proposed approach, a manual ranking done by a ra- diology expert was used: for each medical case, the five corresponding segmentations were ranked by their quality from a medical point of view (we call these the manual rankings). Analogously, for each medical case, 18 rankings of the five segmentations were produced each time using one of metrics (we call these the met- ric rankings). The average correlation between manual rankings and metric rankings was computed for each metric and finally the metrics were sorted according to this average correlation. The resulting metric ranking ( <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> column 'manual') was used as a ground truth suitability ranking of the metrics to validate the auto- matic ranking. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> column 'automatic' contains for each metric the bias (Equation 6) and the corresponding suitability rank computed according to ascending bias. A moderate to strong correlation between the two rank- ings can be observed. The six best metrics are the same in both rankings. This correlation shows that metrics with low bias produce rankings that are more corre- lated to manual rankings than others.</p></div>

A further issue to be in- vestigated in future work is the influence of weight- ing the properties in Equation 6 on the metric suit- ability ranking, if it is known that particular proper- ties are more/less important for the segmentation goal. For example, the manual ranking used to validate this method is done by a radiologist who may emphasise recall on cost of precision to assure that the tumor is completely removed. In this case weighting the recall and precision properly could improve the result.</p></div>
