<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Proof Generator</head><p>We assume the reader is familiar with the chase procedure. Recall that the chase for a database D and a set Σ of rules, denoted chase(D, Σ), is a universal model of D and Σ, and thus (D ∪ Σ) |= q iff chase(D, Σ) |= q, for each CQ q. The instance chase(D, Σ) can be naturally seen as a directed labeled graph, called chase graph, denoted CG(D, Σ). It is also easy to verify that for linear rules, CG(D, Σ) is a directed forest; for details on the chase, see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Our main technical tool is called proof generator, and it formalizes the intuitive idea that (Boolean) CQ answering under linear rules can be realized as a reachability problem on the chase graph. Let us illustrate the key ideas underlying the proof generator via a simple example. </p><note type="other">p(X, Y, Z) → ∃W p(Y, X, W ) p(X, Y, Z) → p(Y, Z, X). Given the BCQ q = ∃A∃B∃C∃D (p(A, a, B) ∧ p(C, B, b) ∧ p(D, c, b)), as shown in Figure 1(a)</note><p>, there exists a homomorphism h (dashed arrows in the figure) that maps q to an initial segment of the chase graph of D and Σ, and thus (D∪Σ) |= q. It is interesting to observe that the nulls occurring in h(q), i.e. ) the forest F , that encodes how the nulls of h(q) depend on each other, as well as the order of their generation, is what we call a proof generator for q w.r.t. D and Σ. The existence of such a triple, allows us to generate the part of the chase due to which the query is entailed, i.e., the proof of the query (hence the name "proof generator"). Therefore, for query answering purposes under linear rules, we simply need to check if such a proof generator exists.</p><p>Lemma 1. (D ∪ Σ) |= q iff there exists a proof generator for q w.r.t. D and Σ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Combined Rewriting</head><p>We give a positive answer to our research question regarding linear rules and the poly- nomial combined approach. More precisely, we show that: To establish the above theorem, we heavily rely on the notion of the proof generator. Fix a (Boolean) CQ q, a database D, and a set Σ of linear rules. By Lemma 1, it suffices to construct in polynomial time a query q Σ ∈ Q (independently of D), and a database D Σ (independently of q), such that D Σ |= q Σ iff a proof generator for q w.r.t. D and Σ exists. Roughly, the query q Σ guesses a triple <ref type="figure">(h, ν, F ) (as described in  Example 1</ref>), and then verifies that the guessed triple is a proof generator for q w.r.t. D and Σ. The interesting part of q Σ is the component that applies the crucial reachability checks required by the definition of the proof generator. Although the path among two atoms in the chase graph may be of exponential size, its existence can be checked via Q-queries of polynomial size. An immediate consequence of The results of this work are, for the moment, of theoretical nature and we do not claim that they will directly lead to better practical algorithms. We believe that a smart implementation of the proposed techniques can lead to more efficient rewriting proce- dures; this will be the subject of future research. We are also planning to optimize the proposed rewriting algorithm, with the aim of constructing queries of optimal size.  <ref type="bibr">(2012) 2.
