  <abstractText>The user interface is the most important feature of interaction between users and (AAL) services. Explicitly defined user interfaces are bound to a specific toolkit and programming language or markup language. Thus a separate user interface definition has to be created manually for different classes of I/O devices to be supported. Compared to manual user interface creation, the automatic or semi-automatic generation of user interfaces based on interaction descriptions considerably reduces the manual effort necessary for integrating a large number of devices and therefore automatically increases the number of supported devices. The main goal of this paper is to provide an overview of selected existing solutions for the definition of generic user interactions and the generation of user interfaces. The comparison shows that the aspect of adaptability is partly covered by the presented User Interaction Description Languages. Nevertheless it is important to analyze them with respect to additional criteria, like accessibility, context-and use-case awareness, to receive a meaningful overview of advantages and drawbacks of the different approaches leading to a good basis for choosing one of the presented approaches.</abstractText>
