			<abstract>
				<p>Business networking relies on application-specific quantity and quality of information in order to support social infrastructures in, e.g., energy allocation coordinated by smart grids, healthcare services with electronic health records, traffic management with personal sensors, RFID in retail and logistics , or integration of individuals&apos; social network information into good, services, and rescue operations. Due to the increasing reliance of networking applications on sharing ICT services , dependencies threaten privacy, security, and reliability of information and, thus, innovative business applications in smart societies. Resilience is becoming a new security approach , since it takes dependencies into account and aims at achieving equilibriums in case of opposite requirements. This special issue on &apos;Security and Privacy in Business Networking&apos; contributes to the journal &apos;Electronic Markets&apos; by introducing a different view on achieving acceptable secure business networking applications in spite of threats due to covert channels. This view is on adapting resilience to enforcement of IT security in business networking applications. Our analysis shows that privacy is an evidence to measure and improve trustworthy relationships and reliable interactions between participants of business processes and their IT systems. The articles of this special issue, which have been accepted after a double-blind peer review, contribute to this view on interdis-ciplinary security engineering in regard to the stages of security and privacy requirements analysis, enforcement of resulting security requirements for an information exchange, testing with a privacy-preserving detection of policy violations , and knowledge management for the purpose of keeping business processes resilient. His Cabinet 2013). One aim of these initiatives is that systems, such as business networking applications, social infrastructures, and a society become resilient. Changes and vulnerabilities should be identified and analyzed to foresee and prevent incidents of any kind, as well as to react accordingly in acceptable time. Resilient ICT then supports the increased, sustainable welfare of a society. The key approach for gaining information on vulnerabil-ities and predicting incidents will be the ability to access and to analyze huge amounts of data in nearly real-time and to implement so-called Big Data analytics successfully. Service providers will collect, aggregate, and analyze data from various sources provided by</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PET and dependencies</head><p>After converting obligations into provisions, PET enforces them while considering violations of confidentiality of isola- tion. The assumption is an idealized threat model assuming ICT systems as being correct whereas trustworthiness of parsecondary use, and non-authorized profiling according to the master identity of a participating party. It can be achieved by restricting availability of information or the information itself (Gilliot et al. 2009). This, in turn, threatens Big Data analytics with an increase of its error probability by introducing faulty information or the non-availability of sufficient quantity, whereas this does not depend on the type of machine learning scheme (Biggio et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2011).</p><p>Encryption protects information before access has taken place. However, after decryption, protection is no longer provided and information can be leaked via an unknown dependency. Identity management with anonymized creden- tials achieves accountability and unobservability as long as further disclosure to third parties is not considered (Camenisch and Lysanskaya 2001). A non-linkable delegation of rights achieves unobservability and accountability in an information exchange with an intermediary under the assump- tion that the modeled recipient of the information as the last data consumer in its exchange is trustworthy and its ICT system has no vulnerability (Wohlgemuth and Müller 2006). However, this is not realistic for a spontaneous information exchange with an intermediary.</p><p>Our analysis of dependencies in a spontaneous information exchange and today's mechanisms to enforce its security model in accordance with the security and privacy interests of the participants shows that an incident and its propagation to a secure ICT system is always possible. On one hand, it is possible that an attacker can control the identity of this participant. On the other hand, strengthening transparency by consensus protocols or confidentiality by PET with reducing the information raises an incident on dependent information exchanges.</p><p>Homomorphic encryption schemes (Dolev and Yao 1983) enforce confidentiality and integrity of information and, at the same time, preserve its availability. Their general suitability is uncertain due to their required computing performance of the cryptographic scheme and a mismatch in abstraction of the information (Naehrig et al. 2011).</p><p>Resilience as an approach for IT security and privacy At present security and privacy in business networking is based on a system and threat model, which includes a limited set of possible information exchanges and incidents. It considers expected states and dependencies including those, which have already passed. A partial model can be achieved for any sub- system, which does not change for an adequate time. However, this is not reality for many actual business networking applica- tions which are highly dynamic and agile. Since vulnerabilities from dependencies arise during run-time and cannot be completely known and predicted, the 'pure' model-based ap- proach is not adequate for preventing and reacting in this context. It is not (at least not efficiently) possible to model all possible changes and incidents and, thus, security with 'pure' model-based approaches will have to follow changes in busi- ness networks and their underlying technology.</p><p>Extending 'pure' model-based security and privacy ap- proaches to the dynamic and unforeseeable context of actual business networking means having to address these vulnerabil- ities and dependencies. The general view then changes from achieving 'pure' security to preserving an acceptable level of service of a system that corresponds to a compromise of the individual security and privacy interests of the participants in an information exchange. Preserving an acceptable level of service of a system requires constantly adapting its dependencies to incidents (Holling 2001), a concept that is also known as resilience. However, a general statement on the resilience of a system cannot be made. It corresponds to a certain incident and the ability of a system to recover within a certain time for response and composite costs and risks (Haimes 2009). Since neither individual security and privacy interests (and compro- mises) nor vulnerabilities remain identical over time, an adap- tion of security and privacy enforcement is required.</p><p>Thus, it is worth thinking about improving security and privacy in business networking by using methods and tools that support resilience of social infrastructures, i.e. in particu- lar Big Data analytics and information exchange on incidents. For data providers and data consumers approaches are re- quired that allow both to balance the benefit and the level of service, respectively, the security or privacy risk associated with information exchange. This means that, e.g., a data provider should be able to check before an information ex- change takes place whether a data consumer might violate obligations for the information exchange. Vice versa, a data consumer should be able to check a priori of an information exchange whether the received information is the expected one and the data provider has followed the agreed-upon security policy for this information exchange. From an eco- nomic theory point of view, this leads to an asymmetric information situation that can usually be solved (or at least improved) by signalling or screening mechanisms (Furubotn and Richter 2005). Thus, new technical approaches that ad- dress the reduction of information asymmetry are being discussed as suitable methods and tools for improving security and privacy in business networking.</p><p>ICT Resilience -a signaling and screening architecture To empower data providers and data consumers to assess and balance the benefit and risk of entering an information ex- change, classical security methods and tools should be complemented by methods and tools that support their decision making. To reduce information asymmetry, signalling compo- nents should give a participant a tool to generate evidence on his actual data usage to prove trustworthiness according to theseveral information exchanges. In turn, a screening component should give a participant a tool to prove that exchanged infor- mation has been used as intended (or not). These tools are to be combined with accountability and an (economic) incentive system that allows each participant to evaluate the value of an information exchange according to the security configuration, the achievable level of, e.g. unobservability or accountability, and individual risk preferences.</p><p>In accordance with our analysis and adapting current ap- proaches for resilience to security and privacy in business networking, we use the following five components to catego- rize methods and tools, as well as open research issues for ICT Resilience.</p><p>&amp; System Evolution aims at automatic improvement of the security configuration for an isolation and replacement of compromised ICT systems or participants, respectively. A removal of systems implies revocation of rights, which can be, e.g. realized by revocation mechanisms for credentials. In the case of accessed data, information has to be removed along the subsequent data trace or at least made useless. Data provenance and data mining technologies can support auditing whether this information has indeed been removed.</p><p>&amp; A Usage Control Policy Tool Box aims at formalizing isolation patterns for expected information exchanges and anti-isolation patterns for classes of anomalies of an isolation. On one hand, this is required for expressing the interest of the parties involved in an information ex- change. On the other hand, this is a basis for detecting anomalies, incidents, and policy violations, as well as for generating correct incident reports and their exchange. The set of patterns should be extensible to cater for newly detected patterns during runtime and for previously un- known interferences and results. &amp; Privacy Control aims at self-protecting against informa- tion leakage. The real identities of data providers should remain unobservable when information is going to be disclosed to third parties. This requires, e.g., identity man- agement supporting pseudonymity and non-linkable del- egation of rights. Pseudonymity should be revocable in case of provable fraud. &amp; Privacy Forensics aims at deriving evidence on isolation by the most probable data processing including its depen- dencies and its classification to an anomaly pattern. A data provenance scheme could derive such evidence. However, since internal dependencies of an external ICT system are usually not known, supervised machine learning in com- bination with labeled evidence could be useful for deriv- ing the probabilities of possible information exchange. Since not all kind of data can be annotated, mechanisms of unsupervised machine learning should also be researched according to their suitability. &amp; IT Risk Analysis aims at evaluating and combining both types of evidence to result in a qualitative (or quantitative) statement on isolation, on information exchanges and, thus, on security and privacy in the corresponding business net- working application. This component should consider re- sults from, e.g., the Big Data analytics and information exchange on incidents. Based on the results of the risk analysis, an information exchange can be balanced, i.e. the corresponding security policies and compromises can be decided according to all the participants' risk preferences.</p><p>We do not wish to claim that these five components are the silver bullet to achieving ICT Resilience, however, we expect that they can provide an initial categorization for topics that address security and privacy in future business networking. Summarizing, an ICT system providing a signaling-and- screening architecture of ICT Resilience is by itself a business networking application in providing 'security-as-a-service' with all its dependencies, vulnerabilities, and possibilities to violate the privacy interests of data providers. Since security and privacy cannot be guaranteed by technology alone, other means should foster the participation of individuals and cor- rectness of their data and services. Data protection acts com- bined with adequate incentives are one option, however, they require reliable methods and tools for signaling and screening of actual behavior of all participants without harming their privacy and security interests. We see the challenges as inter- esting areas for research and finding solutions as a prerequisite for exploiting the potential of business networking applica- tions relying on extensive data processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Papers within ICT Resilience</head><p>All papers of this special issue contribute to one of the pre- sented components of ICT Resilience. Dehling and Sunyaev ('Secure provision of Patient-Centered Health Information Technology Services in Public Networks-Leveraging Security and Privacy Features Provided by the German Nationwide Health Information Technology Infrastructure') address the component Usage Control Policy Toolbox. They investigate security and privacy in business networking using the example of patient-centered health ICT services (PHS) based on the German infrastructure gematik. They identify security and privacy requirements of PHS, which could serve as a starting point for specifying isolation patterns for an information exchange of patients' health data between medi- cal service providers and third parties.</p><p>Gogoulos, Antonakopoulou, Lioudakis, Mousas, Kaklamani, and Venieris ('On the design of a privacy aware authorization engine for collaborative environment') also ad- dress the component Usage Control Policy Toolbox with a proposal for enforcing isolation of cross-organization informaauthorizations for data processing from a semantic model in accordance with the privacy and security interests of the participants.</p><p>Kieseberg, Schrittwieser, Mulazzani, Echizen, and Weippl ('An algorithm for collusion-resistant anonymization and fin- gerprinting of sensitive microdata') refer to Privacy Forensics in case of the disclosure of anonymized information to third parties. They present a k-anonymization scheme, which tags anonymized information by the procedure of their anonymization. Their evaluation considers colluding data consumers with the aim of non-authorized re-identification of the related identity to this information.</p><p>Rechert, von Suchodoletz, and Valizada ('Take Care of Your Belongings Today-Securing Accessibility to Complex Electronic Business Processes') address accessibil- ity of information for the purpose of keeping business pro- cesses resilient. Since the outcome and costs of reconstructing archived information with the configuration of the corre- sponding instance of a business process are difficult to esti- mate, their proposal is to emulate their reconstruction in possible future data processing environments using software. The aim is to identify clearly defined and controllable preser- vation strategies, which should be integrated in current busi- ness processes. This forecasting and emulation approach is one option for supporting the continuous learning of isolation and anti-isolation patterns for IT Risk Analysis.</p><p>We thank all authors for their valuable submissions, re- viewers and senior editors for the thorough and constructive comments and recommendations, and the editorial office for their support in editing this special issue. <ref type="figure">acatech (Ed.).
