The goal of this master thesis is to nd a closed-form solution for the price of European call options where the underlying securities follow a GARCH process. The data are simulated over a wide range to cover a lot of existing options in one single equation.
Genetic Programming is used to generate the pricing function from the data. Genetic Programming is a method of producing programs just by defining a problemdependent fitness function. The resulting equation is found via a heuristic algorithm inspired by natural evolution. Three different methods of bloat control are used. Additionally Automatic Defined Functions (ADFs) and a hybrid approach are tested, too. To ensure that a good configuration setting is used, preliminary testing of many different settings has been done, suggesting that simpler configurations are more successful in this environment.
The resulting equation can be used to calculate the price of an option in the given range with minimal errors. This equation is well behaved and can be used in standard spread sheet programs.

Zusammenfassung Diese Diplomarbeit beschäftigt sich mit Local Branching, einem lokalen Suchalgorithmus, der auf einem Branch and Cut Algorithmus für ganzzahlige Optimierungsprobleme aufsetzt. Local Branching definiert beliebig große Nachbarschaften um gegebene gültige Lösungen und löst diese teilweise oder komplett, bevor der Rest des Lösungsraums durchsucht wird. Das Ziel ist eine Verbesserung des heuristischen Verhaltens des gegebenen Solvers für ganzzahlige Optimierungsprobleme, d.h. sich auf das möglichst frühe Finden guter Lösungen zu konzentrieren. Local Branching ist als Erweiterung des Open Source Branch and Cut Solvers COIN/BCP implementiert. Das Hauptziel des Frameworks ist eine generische Implementierung von Local Branching für ganzzahlige Optimierungsprobleme, also Probleme, bei denen alle oder einige Variablen ganzzahlig sein müssen, und zusätzlich eine oder mehrere (lineare) Bedingungen in Form von Ungleichungen erfüllen müssen. Es wurden mehrere Erweiterungen zum Framework hinzugefügt: die pseudo-parallele Abarbeitung mehrerer lokaler Suchbäume, das vorzeitige Terminieren lokaler Suchbäume sowie eine unabhängige Variablen-Fixing-Heuristik. Durch diese Erweiterungen können die Parameter für Local Branching im Laufe der Berechnung beliebig verändert werden. Ein wesentliches Ziel beim Entwurf des Frameworks war eine klare Kapselung des Local Branching Algorithmus, um die Einbettung in andere, höhere Suchalgorithmen zu ermöglichen, etwa in evolutionäre Algorithmen. Als Beispielapplikation wurde ein Solver für das mehrdimensionale Rucksackproblem implementiert. Eine eigene Local Branching Metaheuristik beschränkt die Größe lokaler Bäume durch Knotenlimits und kann den Suchraum durch Anwendung der Variablen-Fixing-Heuristik weiter einschränken. Die Testergebnisse zeigen signifikante Vorteile für Local Branching im Vergleich zum normalen Branch and Cut Algorithmus. Vor allem für große, komplexe Testinstanzen liefert die Suche in lokalen Bäumen oft bessere Resultate am Anfang der Berechnung. Dadurch wird auch die Zeit zum Finden (und Beweisen) der optimalen Lösung potentiell verringert, da dadurch früher zusätzliche Teile des Suchbaums weggeschnitten werden können.";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

Kurzfassung In dieser Diplomarbeit wird eine generische Bibliothek von effizienten Metaheuris-tiken für kombinatorische Optimierungsprobleme vorgestellt. In der vorliegenden Eine generische Implementierung bietet vorallem den Vorteil das bei einem neuen zu lösendem Problem nur einige bestimmte problemabhängige Klassen und Metho-den realisiert werden müssen ohne sich schon im Vorhinein einen speziellen Algorith-mus festzulegen, da diese Klassen und Methoden von allen in der EAlib vorhanden Metaheuristiken verwendet werden. Die Vorteile dieser Bibliothek werden anschließend anhand des Quadratic Assignment Problems ausführlich dargestellt. Dieses Beispiel dient zusätzlich auch noch als kommentierte Referenz für zukünftige Problemimplentierungen. Abschließend werden die Resulate der Experimente mit den verschiedenen Meta-heuristiken präsentiert. 1 Danksagung An dieser stelle möchte ich mich bei allen Menschen bedanken die zum Gelingen dieser Diplomarbeit beigetragen haben.

Plato Plato 1 implements the PLANETS 2 Preservation Planning approach [2] which provides a solid way of making informed and accountable decisions on which solution to put into practise in order to optimally preserve digital objects for a given purpose. The tool is integrated into the PLANETS Interop-erability Framework based on open J2EE and web technologies. Through this environment it integrates registries and services for preservation action and characterisation through flexible discovery and invocation. Characterisation services such as DROID 3 and JHove 4 are used for format identification and property extraction; based on this information, applicable action services such as emula-tion tools or the migration services provided by CRiB[3] are discovered through available registries. Comparison and validation of objects as an essential feature of the system maps the specified requirements such as essential object characteristics to measurable criteria that can be compared automatically. It thus considerably improves the repeatability, documentation and automation of preservation planning. Plato has been developed with very close attention to the web user interface to not impose any technical restrictions on the user when determining the requirements. Figure 1 shows the requirements for a preservation endeavour of a web archive laid out in a tree structure. The tool offers a fully flexible way to enable the specification of a wide range of measurement scales. As the definition of requirements in a tree structure is often done in a workshop setting, Plato also supports tree import from mind-mapping software 5. The applicability and usefulness of the tool has been validated in a series of workshops and case studies which involved various institutions [2, 1].";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

However, in contrast to analog objects such as books that directly represent their content, digital objects are not usable without a corresponding technical environment. The fast changes in these environments and in formats and technologies mean that digital documents have a short lifespan before they become obsolete. Digital preservation, i.e. actions to ensure longevity of digital information, thus has become a pressing challenge. The dominant strategies prevailing today are migration and emulation; for each strategy, different tools are available. When converting an object to a different representation, a validation of the content is needed to verify that the transformed objects are still authentically representing the same intellectual content. This validation so far is largely done manually, which is infeasible for large collections.
Preservation planning supports decision makers in reaching accountable decisions by evaluating potential strategies against well-defined requirements. Especially the evaluation of different migration tools for digital preservation has to rely on validating the converted objects and thus on an analysis of the logical structure and the content of documents. Existing approaches for characterising and describing objects do not attempt to fully extract the informational content of digital objects and thus are not suffficient for an in-depth validation of transformed content.
This paper describes the eXtensible Characterisation Languages (XCL) that support the automatic validation of document conversions and the evaluation of migration quality by hierarchically decomposing a document and representing documents from different sources in an abstract XML language. The description language XCDL provides an abstract representation of digital content in XML, while the extraction language XCEL allows an extraction engine to create such an abstract description by mapping file format structures to XCDL concepts. We present the context of the development of these languages and tools and describe the overall concept and features of the languages.

Regarding several constraints typically stated by spare parts suppliers the time needed to collect articles should be minimized. Based on continuously arriving orders by customers predefined delivery times and capacity constraints have to be met. To accomplish this task efficient pickup tours need to be determined which is the main issue covered by this work which comes to an end with experimental results of a concrete implementation of the proposed approach.
The algorithm presented embeds a specifically developed dynamic program for computing optimal walks through the warehouse into a general variable neighborhood search (VNS) scheme. Several stages are used for first splitting up all orders, then creating tours out of the results and finally assigning them to available workers. The VNS uses a variant of the variable neighborhood descent (VND) as local improvement procedure. While the neighborhood structures defined are intended to produce candidate solutions, a dynamic program specially designed to compute optimal order picking tours is used to evaluate them. For this purpose properties specific to warehouses are exploited such to compute optimal routes within polynomial time. The final assignment of workers to tours is realized by another VNS. The task is then to find an allocation such that the last article to be picked up will be collected as early as possible.
Evaluations of experimental results of a concrete implementation indicate that the presented approach provides valuable pickup plans and computation times can be kept low. Moreover the performed test runs have been compared to a reference solution which was computed based on an approach found in relevant literature. A detailed analysis of the obtained results showed that the application of the proposed approach to real-world instances is promising whereas the savings with respect to working time can be kept high. Overall an efficient as well as effective approach is introduced to solve this real-world problem.";;"none extracted value";"0,00";"0,00"

This paper outlines a newly added component of cc? for testing similarly parameterised correspondence problems based on uniform equivalence. 1 Motivation and General Information An important issue in software development is to determine whether two encodings of a given problem are equivalent, i.e., whether they yield the same result on a given problem instance. Depending on the context of problem representations, different definitions of ""equivalence"" are useful and desirable. The system cc? [1] (short for ""correspondence-checking tool"") is devised as a checker for a broad range of different such comparison relations defined between disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) under the answer-set semantics [2]. In a previous version of cc?, the system was designed to test correspondence between logic programs based on relativised strong equivalence under answer-set projection. Such a setting generalises the standard notion of strong equivalence [3] by taking the alphabet of the context programs as well as the projection of the compared answer sets to a set of designated output atoms into account [4].

We report on the analysis and solutions identified by the Functionality Working Group of the DL.org project during its deliberations on DL interoperability. Ultimately, we hope that work based on our perspective will lead to improved architectures and software, as well as to greater interoperability, for next-generation DL systems. 1 Introduction A huge volume of information and knowledge is acquired and managed by distinct Digital Libraries (DLs). This leads to problems for academic and public libraries that often work with scores of such DLs and seek to support patrons facing a broad range of systems and services. Similar problems are faced by students, faculty, researchers, scholars, knowledge workers, and the general public. Also of concern is e-science, where labs and centers must use different DLs to address global challenges. Interoperability among all the DLs needed in each case is a serious concern. Manifesting a broad range of features and capabilities, DL systems employ diverse proprietary solutions and varying applications of a broad range of standards. The problem is further aggravated by the complexity and scale of modern DL systems and problems such as API mismatch, data format mismatch, and missing components. Interoperability has been the main issue of concern for the DL.org project [4]. Its work is based on the DELOS Digital Library Reference Model [3], in particular, the multi-dimensional representation of the DL domain and the identification of six primary concepts that characterize Digital Libraries: content, users, functionality, policy, quality, and architecture. In this paper, we present results from the discussions";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

Kurzfassung Topologie ist die mathematisch adäquate Art, umüberum¨umüber Konvergenz zu sprechen. Distributed Computing ist das formale Studium von verteilten Systemen. Die Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit zwei Anwendungen der Topologie im Bereich des Distributed Computing: (1) Mengentheoretische Topologie und (2) algebraische Topologie. Erstere wird verwendet, um die topologische Struktur von unendlichen Bäumen, die die InformationüberInformation¨Informationüber mögliche Ausführungen der Algorithmen sub-sumieren, zu untersuchen. Dieses Wissen wird verwendet, um einen einheitlichen Beweis der Unmöglichkeit von Distributed Consensus in mehreren Systemmo-dellen zu geben. Consensus ist das Einigen aller Prozesse des Systems auf einen einzigen Wert. Zweitere wird verwendet, um die kombinatorische Struktur von Konfiguratio-nen, also der Zusammenfassung aller lokaler Zustände der Prozesse, zu untersu-chen. Hierbei wird eine Konfiguration als Simplex in einem Simplizialkomplex aufgefasst. Die topologische Unvereinbarkeit solcher Komplexe ermöglicht einen Beweis der Unmöglichkeit von k-Set Agreement in gewissen Systemen. Das ist eine Verallgemeinerung des Consensus-Problems: Es wird nicht mehr verlangt, dass sich die Prozesse auf nur einen Wert einigen, sondern es wird erlaubt, dass bis zu k unterschiedliche Werte auftreten.";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

Die Lösungsarchive werden dazu benutzt Lösungen zu speichern, um Duplikate zu erkennen und diese in neue Lösungen umzuwandeln. Das eine Lösungsarchiv beruht auf einer Kodierung, bei der die ausgewählten Knoten der Cluster einer Lösung gespeichert werden, während das andere Archiv auf einer Kodierung beruht, bei der gespeichert wird, welche Cluster in der Lösung verbunden sind. Diese Archive werden in dieser Arbeit durch eine Bounding-Strategie basierend auf dem Branch and Bound Verfahren erweitert. Dabei wird versucht im Archiv an günstigen Positionen geeignete Bounds zu berechnen, die Auskunft darüber geben, wie gut die Lösungen in diesem Bereich des Archivs höchstens sein können. Wird eine Bound gefunden, die schlechter als die beste gefunden Lösung ist, sind diese Lösungen im weiteren Verlauf des Algorithmus uninteressant und werden nicht mehr berücksichtigt. Das führt dazu, dass mehrere Lösungen von vornherein als schlecht erkannt werden können und somit nur Lösungen verfolgt werden, die auch Verbesserungen bringen können. Zusätzlich zu der Bounding-Strategie wird auch noch ein Nearest Neighbour Ansatz verwendet, bei dem beim Anhängen eines Clusters an den Spannbaum die n näch-sten Nachbarcluster bevorzugt werden. Am Ende der Arbeit wurden Tests durchgeführt, bei denen die Bounding Strate-gie in den unterschiedlichen Archiven verwendet wurde. Diese Tests führten zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Bounding Strategie zu einer Verbesserung gegenüber den Archiven ohne Bounding Strategie führt.

In addition to the bounding strategy a nearest neighbor approach is implemented in which a cluster attached to the spanning tree is preferred among the the n nearest neighboring clusters. Tests were carried out in which the bounding strategy was used in the different variants. These tests led to the conclusion that the bounding strategy leads to an improvement in comparison to the ""normal"" archives. The comparison between the archives shows that the pop version lead to better results than the gosh version. When both archives are used simultaneously, the results are better than the results of the other two variants.";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

Das Problem tritt hauptsächlich im Bereich des Netzwerk-Routings beim Multicast auf, das heißt wenn Pakete von einer einzelnen Quelle zu einer bestimmten Untermenge der anderen Netzwerk-Teilnehmer gesendet werden sollen. Da das RDCSTP, wie das ursprüngliche Steiner-Problem, zur Klasse der N P-schwierigen Probleme gehört, ist es allgemein nicht möglich die exakte Lösung einer großen Probleminstanz in vertret-barer Zeit zu finden. Der Fokus der Forschung liegt daher großteils auf der Entwicklung guter Heuristiken, die auch bei großen Probleminstanzen in der Lage sind in vergleichbar kurzer Zeit zu möglichst guten Lösungen zu kommen. In dieser Arbeit wird hierfür die Multilevel-Refinement-Heuristik-die bereits erfolgreich auf etliche andere Probleme, wie das Graph Partitioning Problem, angewandt wurde-als Ver-besserungsheuristik für das RDCSTP entwickelt. Grundsätzlich werden bei dieser Metaheuristik in einem ersten Schritt Knoten sukzessive zusammengefasst um den Graphen auf höheren ""Lev-els"", mit weniger Knoten, darzustellen. Das so vereinfachte Problem kann dann auf der höchsten Abstraktionsebene in simpler Weise gelöst werden. Dann wird diese Lösung schrittweise wieder soweit verfeinert, bis eine Lösung für das ursprüngliche Problem erreicht wird. Der hier vorgestellte Algorithmus für das RDCSTP implementiert diesen Multilevel-Ansatz als Verbesserungsheuristik, die eine existierende Lösung iterativ verändert. Er wurde allerdings in einer Weise entworfen, die es ihm ebenso erlaubt eine Anfangslösung selbst zu generieren. Eine weitere Besonderheit ist, dass wegen der zusätzlichen Verzögerungs-Einschränkung wei-tere Datenstrukturen benötigt werden, um auf höheren Levels möglichst gültige Lösungen zu erzeugen. Außerdem wird während der Verfeinerung der Lösung auf jedem Level eine weite-re Verbesserungsheuristik angewandt, das Key Path Improvement, welches die Lösungsqualität drastisch verbessert. Umfangreiche experimentelle Tests wurden durchgeführt um die Leistungsfähigkeit des Al-gorithmus bei großen Instanzen zu messen, und ihn mit anderen Algorithmen aus der Literatur zu vergleichen. Die hierbei erhaltenen Ergebnisse sind durchwegs sehr positiv und weisen somit darauf hin, dass der verfolgte Multilevel-Ansatz tatsächlich eine konkurrenzfähige Heuristik für das RDCSTP darstellt. vii";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

Wenn das Netzwerk als Graph repräsentiert ist, ist dieses NP-vollständige Problem wie folgt definiert: Gegeben ist Menge von Knoten welche jeweils einer von drei Schichten zugewiesen sind, und eine Kostenfunktion, welche die Verbindungskosten zwischen zwei Knoten (d.h. Kantenkosten) zuweist. Gesucht ist ein zusammenhängendes Netzwerk mit minimalen Gesamtkosten, wobei dieses bestimmte Struktureigenschaften zu erfüllen hat, welche im Detail in der Diplomarbeit beschrieben werden. Die wichtigste dieser Eigenschaften ist, dass Knoten gemäß einer hierarchischen Struktur zu größenbeschränkten Ringen verbunden werden. Ringstrukturen sind ein guter Kompromiss zwischen der Verfügbarkeit von Netzwerken und deren Herstellungskosten. Die Verfügbarkeit ist gewährleistet, solange maximal ein Knoten pro Ring ausfällt. Die grundlegende Idee dieser Diplomarbeit um dieses Netzwerkdesign-Problem zu lösen, ist die Knoten mit Hilfe von hierarchischen Clusteringalgorithmen anzuordnen und die resul-tierende Hierarchie für nachfolgende Heuristiken zu verwenden, welche die Ringe finden. Vorhergehende Ansätze für vergleichbare Netzwerkdesign-Probleme haben die inhärente Netzwerkstruktur nicht auf solche Weise genützt und eher Greedy-Heuristiken eingesetzt. Um gültige Ringe zu finden, wurden drei Heuristiken implementiert. Strategisches Variieren der erlaubten Ringgröße hilft der ersten Heuristik Ringe unter Benützung der Cluster-Hierarchie zu finden. Die zweite Heuristik baut auf den in der vorherigen Schicht gefundenen Ringen auf, indem sie nach gültigen Pfaden sucht, die an diese Ringe angeschlossen werden können. Drittens wird eine Reparaturheuristik angewendet, welche versucht verbleibende Knoten zu bestehenden Ringen zuzuweisen. Zuletzt werden lokale Suchverfahren eingesetzt, um die Gesamtkosten zu verbessern. Um zu überprüfen, wie gut dieser Lösungsansatz funktioniert, wurden zwei Testinstanz-Generatoren implementiert. Der Erste generiert Instanzen zufallsbasiert, der Zweite baut auf dem bekannten TSPLIB-Archiv auf. Die Evaluierung der zufallsbasierten Testinstanzen hat gezeigt, dass alle drei Heuristiken sämtliche Instanzen lösen konnten, wobei Girvan-Newman und Kernighan-Lin in jedem Testlauf Lösungen gefunden haben, war dies bei K-means nicht der Fall. Mit Kernighan-Lin konnte im Durchschnitt schneller eine Lösung gefunden werden, aber die Gesamtkosten waren bei den beiden anderen Algorithmen etwas besser. Mit den TSPLIB-basierten Testinstanzen konnte nicht mit allen Clusteringalgorithmen eine Lösung erzielt werden, aber zumindest war für jede Testinstanz mindestens ein Clustering-Verfahren erfolgreich. iv";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

As the main source of slowdown during simulation we identified the LLVM code generator. We reduced compilation time in our own experimental code generator by an order of magnitude compared to LLVM's original backend. Current work aims at leveraging instruction descriptions already available in LLVM to extend the coverage of our fast JIT code generator.";"100,00";"100,00";"100,00"

In this paper, we analyze the current barriers to web-based searching by medical practitioners and introduce the European Khresmoi project, which aims to dismantle these barriers. 1. Background Physicians often have unmet information needs. These have been reported as occurring for up to 2 of every 3 patients seen [1], or more recently for 41% of the questions they pursued [2]. Although these medical professionals have many tools for information search available (such as PubMed), studies have revealed that they do not use them to their full capabilities. Most questions arise during consultations and have a direct impact on the medical decision process [3]. There is evidence suggesting that physicians primarily respond to their information needs when they perceive the question to be urgent and believe that definitive answers can be found [4]. However, physicians are often restricted in their search by time constraints [5]. Physicians search on average for less than 5 minutes to answer questions [6]. A so-called ""90 second rule"" has been described in the literature-meaning physicians do not even attempt to find information unless they think they can do it in a minute and a half [7]. Hence, it is important that the pertinent information is found during this time. However, the time taken to answer questions using PubMed averages 30 minutes [1] and the information found is often scattered over multiple articles, making PubMed searching impractical for routine clinical use [6]. Furthermore, physicians that are not native English speakers using systems in English language are prone to use erroneous search terms, resulting in poorer returned results [8]. The World Wide Web has a lot to offer in terms of both quantity and quality of medical information [9]. There is no consensus within the literature as to what extent doctors currently rely on web-based searching as compared to other information sources. One line of research suggests that physicians often find it quicker and easier to look up answers in a pocket reference book or ask a colleague for advice [10] rather than searching on the Internet. In addition current web-based solutions fail to provide psychological support, guidance, affirmation, sympathy, judgement, and feedback, which colleagues can provide within the daily decision making process of a physician. A review by Davies [3] compared relevant research between 2000 and 2005, and found that text books (39%) and colleagues (25%) were the information sources physicians accessed most frequently, while computer resources were used only by 13%. However, an upward trend of Internet use is visible as the highest percentage of use examined in the study, 53%, occurred in the latest published research from 2005. A Spanish study published in 2007 [11] found that the majority of physicians still relied on colleagues, drug compendiums and textbooks rather than on web-based resources. A possible explanation is language as a potential barrier to web-based searching, and it appears to be inadequately addressed by current web-based solutions within the medical domain. In contrast to these findings is research claiming a clear preference of the Internet as a primary informational resource amongst physicians [12],[13]. Both studies provide support for the notion that the Internet has become an important information source amongst physicians. Possible explanations of conflicting study outcomes could be the variance among medical specialities, different geographical locations and potential biases introduced by different methodologies used in the studies (e.g., user observations versus self reports). Furthermore, the rapid changes and advances in the field of information technology make comparisons over larger time spans difficult. There is also conflicting data about which web sites and tools physicians use to look for medical information on the web. Some publications suggest that general-purpose search services such as Google can play a useful role in the medical decision making process [14],[15]. In contrast, Leo et. al. [16] reported that physicians mistrust the quality of results from such search engines and prefer to directly access specialized medical websites. A study by Yu and Kaufman [14] suggests that Google is preferred for finding medical definitions, as it is easy to use and provides good answers to simple questions. However, for more complex information needs more advanced search systems may be required. A recent study funded by Google [13] is in strong contrast with prior findings. It postulates that the majority of physicians use Google or a similar search engine as their primary information sources in the clinical decision making process. However, it is unclear as to what extent the study was biased in terms of sample selection. Another study showed that general practitioners use Google as their first information source, primarily to lead them to higher quality websites [17]. Thus, it appears that physicians are currently willing to use a search engine for simple questions and as an initial source to help them find their way to higher quality websites.";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

The goal is to combine our research topics to an integrated system that helps domain experts to get more insight from their time-oriented data. a natural context, like the change of seasons, they are usually regular , but granularities based on social context can also be irregular, e.g., easter time. They play an important role in many datasets from real-world applications, like customer data from shops. 1.2 Interactive Visualization Application domains where time-oriented-data occur include commerce , health care, public security, and others. These data are usually multivariate, resulting from heterogeneous data sources. In many cases, the structure of time has strongly influenced the events the data results from. The user tasks are complex and involve many abstract questions. By studying surveys of visualizations for time-oriented data like the one by Aigner [1], it becomes apparent that most current work at visualizing time-oriented data is focused on solving one or more of the pressing tasks, but most visualizations neglect the structure of time. In the following, this structure is discussed , as well as what we consider the most important research topics in developing interactive visualizations. User interaction is one of the most important elements of Info-Vis, or even the ""heart"" as Spence states [9]. User interaction is even more important in Visual Analytics, as studies like the one by Saraiya et al. [7] shows: users preferred inferior visualizations with interaction over superior static visualizations. The basic interactions in visualizations of time-oriented data are interval selections, like zooming and panning, but also others like detail on demand or brushing. Most interactions are not tailored particularly for time-oriented data. E.g., if a user analyzes a day and wants to see a day one month later, she often has to go forward 28-31 days, because the visualization is at day scale. It would be easier to just go forward one month, without having to think about details. If another user wants to zoom out to one month, he has not only to respect different month lengths, but also consider that the day viewed before might not be in the center of the month. Still, it is most likely the user wants to see the month that contains the day, from the first day to the last day. These examples show that it is important for interactive visualizations to respect the structure of time.";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

Abstract The Selective Graph Coloring Problem (SGCP) is about finding a subgraph of a particular structure whose chromatic number is as low as possible. The original graph is divided into several clusters, and from each cluster the subgraph has to contain exactly one node. This problem is NP-hard and therefore it is usually solved by means of heuristics. I implemented several variants of an algorithm making use of Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) to search the space of solution candidates and then evaluating the solution using heuristic or exact methods. Furthermore, each variant can be used with or without a solution archive, i.e. a data structure in which previously found solutions are stored so that duplicates need not be re-evaluated but can be efficiently converted into new solutions instead. For exact computation of the chromatic number integer linear programming was used. To obtain an upper bound a variant of greedy coloring was used. Another variant of the algorithm also counts the number of conflicts that would appear if one color less were used. Finally, two methods were implemented to obtain a lower bound: maximum clique and linear programming using column generation. The program was tested with various instances from the literature. My algorithm often finished computation within a very short time, but in general it led to slightly worse results. Kurzfassung Beim Selective Graph Coloring Problem (SGCP) geht es darum, einen Teilgraphen mit spezieller Struktur zu finden, dessen chromatische Zahl so niedrig wie möglich ist. Der Ursprungsgraph ist in mehrere Cluster unterteilt, und von jedem Cluster muss der Teilgraph genau einen Knoten enthalten. Dieses Problem ist NP-schwer und wird daher meistens mit Heuristiken gelöst. Ich habe mehrere Varianten eines Algorithmus implementiert, der Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) benutzt, um den Lösungsraum zu durchsuchen, und dann die gefundene Lösung mit heuristischen oder exakten Methoden evaluiert. Jede Variante kann mit oder ohne ein Lösungsarchiv verwendet werden. Ein Lösungsarchiv ist eine Datenstruktur, in der bereits gefundene Lösungen gespeichert werden, so dass Duplikate nicht neu evaluiert werden müssen, sondern effizient zu neuen Lösungen konvertiert werden können. Um eine obere Schranke zu errechnen, wurde eine Variante von Greedy Coloring verwendet. Eine weitere Variante des Algorithmus zählt auch die Anzahl der Konflikte, die entstünden, würde eine Farbe weniger verwendet werden. Schließlich wurden zwei Methoden umgesetzt, um eine untere Schranke zu berechnen: maximale Clique und lineare Programmierung mit Spaltengenerierung. Das Programm wurde mit verschiedenen Instanzen aus der Literatur getestet. Mein Algorithmus beendete die Berechnungen oft schon nach sehr kurzer Laufzeit, führte aber im Allgemeinen zu geringfügig schlechteren Ergebnissen.";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

We conclude our paper with our future work. INTRODUCTION Seen as a supporting electronic technology e-learning is well-established at several universities for several reasons: to support the lecturers to prepare their courses in a multimodal way, to support students to get all relevant information of a course asynchronously, to provide additional support to students by answering their questions and helping them in their assignments, to name a few. Additional features of creating time schedules, discussion groups and forums among participants, messaging mechanisms, grading and feedback possibilities, etc. make the teaching and learning easier to all stakeholders involved. Nevertheless the most e-learning systems do not provide enough support for learning from students' individual point of view and see learners as ""deindividualized and demoted noncritical homogenous users"" [6, p.273]. In this paper we show that the opposite is the case, especially when considering first semester students of higher education. If it comes to introduce self-regulated learning, it is not only about the material provided for the students [6] or using ICT to improve assessment processes [8], it is about processes like scheduling, planning, and managing the learning activities, or assessment of one's knowledge and preparation for exams, etc. These are the factors for what we show in this paper evidence from our field study. Considering learning as an active, self-regulated, constructive, and situated process [4] [1] e-learning systems need to support learners in management and organization of learning activities, especially when the study requirements are unfamiliar, high (at least higher than expected), and not much individualized. One of the main goals of our paper is to show how to accompany ""novice"" learners in the first semester of a computer science university study to ""advanced beginners"" [3]. Our focus is on e-learning support to self-regulated learning. Since there are several definitions of e-learning, we want to clarify that we refer to the following definition: ""… all forms of electronic supported learning and teaching, which are procedural in character and aim to effect the construction of knowledge with reference to individual experience, practice and knowledge of the learner. Information and communication systems, whether networked or not, serve as specific media (specific in the sense elaborated previously) to implement the learning process."" [6, p.274]. Self-regulation is based on ""students' self-generated thoughts and behaviors that are systematically oriented toward the attainment of their learning goals"" [5, p.59]. This also means that students contribute actively to their learning goals and procedure. The main research question we deal with in this paper is: How can we apply e-learning mechanisms and systems to help students to transit from familiar learning structures and habits at high school to autonomous self-organized learning at a university? This is followed by other questions like: How can we support a newcomer at a university at all? What do we need to consider in a first year computer science (CS)";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"

SOM Visualisierungen bilden die Dimensionen des Datenmod-ells auf graphische Dimensionen wie Farbe und Position ab, so helfen sie der Navigation und dem Erforschen von dem SOM. SOM Visualisierungen können auch die Daten selbst einbeziehen, so dass der Zugri auf Informationen möglich wird, die in einem reinen SOM nicht verfügbar sind. Dadurch wird ein tieferer Einblick in die Daten möglich. Wenn die Daten mit klassen gekennzeichnet sind, können diese Klassen auch in der Visualisierung einbezogen werden, so dass, eine klarere Idee über die Klassinformation gewonnen wird. In dieser Arbeit schlagen wir eine neuartige SOM Visualisierungsmethode, nämlich die SOM Klassenfär-bung vor, welche auf den Datenklassen beruht. Diese Methode ndet eine farbige Partition des SOM-Gitters, die die Klassenstruktur widerspiegelt. Diese Visu-alisierung ermöglicht das entdecken von Klassinformation wie Klassenstruktur, Klassenverteilung und Klassenclusters. Auÿerdem können neue Daten Klassen zugeordnet werden und zwar indem der Punkt auf dem SOM-Gitter ermittelt wird, welcher das neue Datum (Messwert) am besten repräsentiert; das neue Datum wird dann jener Klasse zugeordnet, die die Partition repräsentiert, auf der sich der Punkt bendet.

In our work, we address these issues by creating an in-depth compendium on the intertranslatability of argumentation frameworks, describing approximately eighty translations. Furthermore, we provide a system for analyzing a given transformation in terms of its functional, syntactical, semantical and computational properties and the underlying methodology. Over the last years, argumentation has become an influential subfield of artificial intelligence, with applications ranging from legal reasoning (Bench-Capon, Prakken, and Sartor 2009) to dialogues and persuasion (McBurney and Parsons 2009; Prakken 2009) to medicine (Fox et al. 2010; Hunter and Williams 2012) to eGovernment (Atkinson, Bench-Capon, and McBurney 2006). Within it, we can distinguish the abstract argumentation approaches, at the heart of which lies Dung's argumentation framework (Dung 1995). Since the structure itself was relatively limited, as it took into account only the conflict relation between the arguments, it inspired the search for more general models (Brewka, Pol-berg, and Woltran 2014). Throughout the years, many of its extensions were proposed, ranging from the ones employing various strengths and preferences to those that focus on researching new types of relations between arguments (Baroni et al.). Such an amount of frameworks should not come as a surprise. Argumentation is a wide area with numerous applications , in which one has to face different classes of problems. Frameworks of a given type can be seen as tools to model particular issues and concepts, which on one side gives us more insight into how to approach the problems, but on the other affects the framework's design. Nevertheless, with so many available structures, it is only natural to ask whether one can translate one framework into another, and what are the price and consequences of undergoing this process. The ability to transform one framework into another is both of theoretical and practical value. The majority of the existing formalisms does not have a dedicated solver. Therefore , a translation into one that does, such as Dung's framework or abstract dialectical framework (Egly, Gaggl, and Woltran 2010; Ellmauthaler and Strass 2014), can facilitate the development of argumentation-based applications. Moreover, if our purpose is to solve a variety of problems for which different frameworks are suitable, translations would allow us to choose the most adequate one to work ""in the background"". Our study can be seen as more research-oriented. The behavior of the semantics and what structural changes a framework has to undergo gives us an insight into how e.g. a given relation between arguments works and how it can or cannot be simulated by other concepts. For example, we can try to transform one form of support into another, support into attack or preference into an argument. However, the ability to perform a conversion is one thing; what is also important is the price we need to pay for it, and by this we do not mean just the computational cost of the process. Depending on how intrusive the modifications are, our source framework can be represented in a way that it is no longer possible to retrieve the original structure from it. We can be forced to assume some structure of arguments, drop or add-possibly exponentially many-elements of the framework. As a result, we can reach a point in which propagating the change in the source structure to the target one can become nearly impossible without repeating the translation altogether. This can make using translations in a dynamic setting quite problematic. Finally, even if we manage to create a non-intrusive, well-behaved translation, it might be the case it is such only for a subclass of the possible source frameworks. Similarly, an intricate transformation can be significantly simplified if certain assumptions are made. Therefore , the efficiency, semantics behavior, structural changes and domain coverage attributed with a given translation can be used to compare both the transformations and different argumentation frameworks. The result of our work is an in-depth compendium on the intertranslatability of argumentation frameworks, consisting of approximately eighty translations. Our focus will be on the Dung's framework (Dung 1995), frameworks with joint attacks (Nielsen and Parsons 2007) and recursive attacks (Baroni et al. 2011), extended argumentation framework and its collective generalization (Modgil 2009; Mod-gil and Bench-Capon 2011), bipolar argumentation frame-work(Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2013), argumentation framework with necessities (Nouioua 2013), evidential system (Polberg and Oren 2014) and abstract dialectical framework (Brewka and Woltran 2010). We not only propose a number of new approaches, but also complete and, if necessary , correct, the existing ones (Nielsen and Parsons 2007; Oren, Reed, and Luck 2010; Baroni et al. 2011; Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2009; Nouioua 2013; Brewka et al. 2013; Modgil and Bench-Capon 2011; Oren, Reed, and Luck 2010; Polberg and Oren 2014; Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2013). As a result of our study, the abstract dialectical frameworks emerge as perhaps the most general structures, capable of handling even the extended argumentation framework, for which the existing results were more limited (Modgil and Bench-Capon 2011). In order to be able to compare our approaches and speak of their quality, we also introduce a classification system for describing a given translation in terms of functional, syn-tactical, semantical and computational properties. These attributes are meant to grasp different aspects of a transformation that we have discussed previously. Furthermore, we identify certain common patterns behind various translations and thus also propose to categorize them with respect to the underlying methodology. Finally, when possible, we use the existing research on semantics signatures (Dunne et al. 2015; Dyrkolbotn 2014) in order to show whether the proposed translations can or cannot be replaced by methods with more desirable semantical aspects.";"0,00";"0,00";"0,00"
